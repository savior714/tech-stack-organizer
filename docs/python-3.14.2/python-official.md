Summary – Release highlights[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#summary-release-highlights "Link to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python 3.14 is the latest stable release of the Python programming language, with a mix of changes to the language, the implementation, and the standard library. The biggest changes include [template string literals](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-template-string-literals), [deferred evaluation of annotations](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-deferred-annotations), and support for [subinterpreters](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-multiple-interpreters) in the standard library.

The library changes include significantly improved capabilities for [introspection in asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-asyncio-introspection), [support for Zstandard](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-zstandard) via a new [`compression.zstd`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/compression.zstd.html#module-compression.zstd "compression.zstd: Low-level interface to compression and decompression routines in the zstd library.") module, syntax highlighting in the REPL, as well as the usual deprecations and removals, and improvements in user-friendliness and correctness.

This article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete specification of all new features, but instead gives a convenient overview. For full details refer to the documentation, such as the [Library Reference](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/index.html#library-index) and [Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/index.html#reference-index). To understand the complete implementation and design rationale for a change, refer to the PEP for a particular new feature; but note that PEPs usually are not kept up-to-date once a feature has been fully implemented. See [Porting to Python 3.14](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#porting-to-python-3-14) for guidance on upgrading from earlier versions of Python.

New features[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#new-features "Link to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [**PEP 649**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/)&[**PEP 749**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0749/): Deferred evaluation of annotations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-649-pep-749-deferred-evaluation-of-annotations "Link to this heading")

The [annotations](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-annotation) on functions, classes, and modules are no longer evaluated eagerly. Instead, annotations are stored in special-purpose [annotate functions](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-annotate-function) and evaluated only when necessary (except if `from __future__ import annotations` is used).

This change is designed to improve performance and usability of annotations in Python in most circumstances. The runtime cost for defining annotations is minimized, but it remains possible to introspect annotations at runtime. It is no longer necessary to enclose annotations in strings if they contain forward references.

The new [`annotationlib`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/annotationlib.html#module-annotationlib "annotationlib: Functionality for introspecting annotations") module provides tools for inspecting deferred annotations. Annotations may be evaluated in the [`VALUE`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.VALUE "annotationlib.Format.VALUE") format (which evaluates annotations to runtime values, similar to the behavior in earlier Python versions), the [`FORWARDREF`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF "annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF") format (which replaces undefined names with special markers), and the [`STRING`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.STRING "annotationlib.Format.STRING") format (which returns annotations as strings).

This example shows how these formats behave:

>>> from annotationlib import get_annotations, Format
>>> def func(arg: Undefined):
...     pass
>>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.VALUE)
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
NameError: name 'Undefined' is not defined
>>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.FORWARDREF)
{'arg': ForwardRef('Undefined', owner=<function func at 0x...>)}
>>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.STRING)
{'arg': 'Undefined'}

The [porting](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-porting-annotations) section contains guidance on changes that may be needed due to these changes, though in the majority of cases, code will continue working as-is.

### [**PEP 734**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0734/): Multiple interpreters in the standard library[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-734-multiple-interpreters-in-the-standard-library "Link to this heading")

The CPython runtime supports running multiple copies of Python in the same process simultaneously and has done so for over 20 years. Each of these separate copies is called an ‘interpreter’. However, the feature had been available only through the [C-API](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/subinterpreters.html#sub-interpreter-support).

That limitation is removed in Python 3.14, with the new [`concurrent.interpreters`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/concurrent.interpreters.html#module-concurrent.interpreters "concurrent.interpreters: Multiple interpreters in the same process") module.

There are at least two notable reasons why using multiple interpreters has significant benefits:

*   they support a new (to Python), human-friendly concurrency model

*   true multi-core parallelism

For some use cases, concurrency in software improves efficiency and can simplify design, at a high level. At the same time, implementing and maintaining all but the simplest concurrency is often a struggle for the human brain. That especially applies to plain threads (for example, [`threading`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism.")), where all memory is shared between all threads.

With multiple isolated interpreters, you can take advantage of a class of concurrency models, like Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) or the actor model, that have found success in other programming languages, like Smalltalk, Erlang, Haskell, and Go. Think of multiple interpreters as threads but with opt-in sharing.

Regarding multi-core parallelism: as of Python 3.12, interpreters are now sufficiently isolated from one another to be used in parallel (see [**PEP 684**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0684/)). This unlocks a variety of CPU-intensive use cases for Python that were limited by the [GIL](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-GIL).

Using multiple interpreters is similar in many ways to [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism."), in that they both provide isolated logical “processes” that can run in parallel, with no sharing by default. However, when using multiple interpreters, an application will use fewer system resources and will operate more efficiently (since it stays within the same process). Think of multiple interpreters as having the isolation of processes with the efficiency of threads.

While the feature has been around for decades, multiple interpreters have not been used widely, due to low awareness and the lack of a standard library module. Consequently, they currently have several notable limitations, which are expected to improve significantly now that the feature is going mainstream.

Current limitations:

*   starting each interpreter has not been optimized yet

*   each interpreter uses more memory than necessary (work continues on extensive internal sharing between interpreters)

*   there aren’t many options _yet_ for truly sharing objects or other data between interpreters (other than [`memoryview`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview"))

*   many third-party extension modules on PyPI are not yet compatible with multiple interpreters (all standard library extension modules _are_ compatible)

*   the approach to writing applications that use multiple isolated interpreters is mostly unfamiliar to Python users, for now

The impact of these limitations will depend on future CPython improvements, how interpreters are used, and what the community solves through PyPI packages. Depending on the use case, the limitations may not have much impact, so try it out!

Furthermore, future CPython releases will reduce or eliminate overhead and provide utilities that are less appropriate on PyPI. In the meantime, most of the limitations can also be addressed through extension modules, meaning PyPI packages can fill any gap for 3.14, and even back to 3.12 where interpreters were finally properly isolated and stopped sharing the [GIL](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-GIL). Likewise, libraries on PyPI are expected to emerge for high-level abstractions on top of interpreters.

Regarding extension modules, work is in progress to update some PyPI projects, as well as tools like Cython, pybind11, nanobind, and PyO3. The steps for isolating an extension module are found at [Isolating Extension Modules](https://docs.python.org/3.14/howto/isolating-extensions.html#isolating-extensions-howto). Isolating a module has a lot of overlap with what is required to support [free-threading](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-free-threaded-cpython), so the ongoing work in the community in that area will help accelerate support for multiple interpreters.

### [**PEP 750**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/): Template string literals[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-750-template-string-literals "Link to this heading")

Template strings are a new mechanism for custom string processing. They share the familiar syntax of f-strings but, unlike f-strings, return an object representing the static and interpolated parts of the string, instead of a simple [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#str "str").

To write a t-string, use a `'t'` prefix instead of an `'f'`:

>>> variety = 'Stilton'
>>> template = t'Try some {variety} cheese!'
>>> type(template)
<class 'string.templatelib.Template'>

[`Template`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/string.templatelib.html#string.templatelib.Template "string.templatelib.Template") objects provide access to the static and interpolated (in curly braces) parts of a string _before_ they are combined. Iterate over `Template` instances to access their parts in order:

>>> list(template)
['Try some ', Interpolation('Stilton', 'variety', None, ''), ' cheese!']

It’s easy to write (or call) code to process `Template` instances. For example, here’s a function that renders static parts lowercase and [`Interpolation`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/string.templatelib.html#string.templatelib.Interpolation "string.templatelib.Interpolation") instances uppercase:

from string.templatelib import Interpolation

def lower_upper(template):
 """Render static parts lowercase and interpolations uppercase."""
    parts = []
    for part in template:
        if isinstance(part, Interpolation):
            parts.append(str(part.value).upper())
        else:
            parts.append(part.lower())
    return ''.join(parts)

name = 'Wenslydale'
template = t'Mister {name}'
assert lower_upper(template) == 'mister WENSLYDALE'

Because `Template` instances distinguish between static strings and interpolations at runtime, they can be useful for sanitising user input. Writing a `html()` function that escapes user input in HTML is an exercise left to the reader! Template processing code can provide improved flexibility. For instance, a more advanced `html()` function could accept a `dict` of HTML attributes directly in the template:

attributes = {'src': 'limburger.jpg', 'alt': 'lovely cheese'}
template = t'<img {attributes}>'
assert html(template) == '<img src="limburger.jpg" alt="lovely cheese" />'

Of course, template processing code does not need to return a string-like result. An even _more_ advanced `html()` could return a custom type representing a DOM-like structure.

With t-strings in place, developers can write systems that sanitise SQL, make safe shell operations, improve logging, tackle modern ideas in web development (HTML, CSS, and so on), and implement lightweight custom business DSLs.

### [**PEP 768**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0768/): Safe external debugger interface[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-768-safe-external-debugger-interface "Link to this heading")

Python 3.14 introduces a zero-overhead debugging interface that allows debuggers and profilers to safely attach to running Python processes without stopping or restarting them. This is a significant enhancement to Python’s debugging capabilities, meaning that unsafe alternatives are no longer required.

The new interface provides safe execution points for attaching debugger code without modifying the interpreter’s normal execution path or adding any overhead at runtime. Due to this, tools can now inspect and interact with Python applications in real-time, which is a crucial capability for high-availability systems and production environments.

For convenience, this interface is implemented in the [`sys.remote_exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.html#sys.remote_exec "sys.remote_exec") function. For example:

import sys
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile

with NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', suffix='.py', delete=False) as f:
    script_path = f.name
    f.write(f'import my_debugger; my_debugger.connect({os.getpid()})')

# Execute in process with PID 1234
print('Behold! An offering:')
sys.remote_exec(1234, script_path)

This function allows sending Python code to be executed in a target process at the next safe execution point. However, tool authors can also implement the protocol directly as described in the PEP, which details the underlying mechanisms used to safely attach to running processes.

The debugging interface has been carefully designed with security in mind and includes several mechanisms to control access:

*   A [`PYTHON_DISABLE_REMOTE_DEBUG`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_DISABLE_REMOTE_DEBUG) environment variable.

*   A [`-X disable-remote-debug`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X) command-line option.

*   A [`--without-remote-debug`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/configure.html#cmdoption-without-remote-debug) configure flag to completely disable the feature at build time.

### A new type of interpreter[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#a-new-type-of-interpreter "Link to this heading")

A new type of interpreter has been added to CPython. It uses tail calls between small C functions that implement individual Python opcodes, rather than one large C `case` statement. For certain newer compilers, this interpreter provides significantly better performance. Preliminary benchmarks suggest a geometric mean of 3-5% faster on the standard `pyperformance` benchmark suite, depending on platform and architecture. The baseline is Python 3.14 built with Clang 19, without this new interpreter.

This interpreter currently only works with Clang 19 and newer on x86-64 and AArch64 architectures. However, a future release of GCC is expected to support this as well.

This feature is opt-in for now. Enabling profile-guided optimization is highly recommendeded when using the new interpreter as it is the only configuration that has been tested and validated for improved performance. For further information, see [`--with-tail-call-interp`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-tail-call-interp).

Note

This is not to be confused with [tail call optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) of Python functions, which is currently not implemented in CPython.

This new interpreter type is an internal implementation detail of the CPython interpreter. It doesn’t change the visible behavior of Python programs at all. It can improve their performance, but doesn’t change anything else.

(Contributed by Ken Jin in [gh-128563](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128563), with ideas on how to implement this in CPython by Mark Shannon, Garrett Gu, Haoran Xu, and Josh Haberman.)

### Free-threaded mode improvements[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#free-threaded-mode-improvements "Link to this heading")

CPython’s free-threaded mode ([**PEP 703**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/)), initially added in 3.13, has been significantly improved in Python 3.14. The implementation described in PEP 703 has been finished, including C API changes, and temporary workarounds in the interpreter were replaced with more permanent solutions. The specializing adaptive interpreter ([**PEP 659**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0659/)) is now enabled in free-threaded mode, which along with many other optimizations greatly improves its performance. The performance penalty on single-threaded code in free-threaded mode is now roughly 5-10%, depending on the platform and C compiler used.

From Python 3.14, when compiling extension modules for the free-threaded build of CPython on Windows, the preprocessor variable `Py_GIL_DISABLED` now needs to be specified by the build backend, as it will no longer be determined automatically by the C compiler. For a running interpreter, the setting that was used at compile time can be found using [`sysconfig.get_config_var()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sysconfig.html#sysconfig.get_config_var "sysconfig.get_config_var").

The new [`-X context_aware_warnings`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X) flag controls if [concurrent safe warnings control](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-concurrent-warnings-control) is enabled. The flag defaults to true for the free-threaded build and false for the GIL-enabled build.

A new [`thread_inherit_context`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.html#sys.flags.thread_inherit_context "sys.flags.thread_inherit_context") flag has been added, which if enabled means that threads created with [`threading.Thread`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/threading.html#threading.Thread "threading.Thread") start with a copy of the [`Context()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/contextvars.html#contextvars.Context "contextvars.Context") of the caller of [`start()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.start "threading.Thread.start"). Most significantly, this makes the warning filtering context established by [`catch_warnings`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/warnings.html#warnings.catch_warnings "warnings.catch_warnings") be “inherited” by threads (or asyncio tasks) started within that context. It also affects other modules that use context variables, such as the [`decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/decimal.html#module-decimal "decimal: Implementation of the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification.") context manager. This flag defaults to true for the free-threaded build and false for the GIL-enabled build.

### Improved error messages[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#improved-error-messages "Link to this heading")

*   The interpreter now provides helpful suggestions when it detects typos in Python keywords. When a word that closely resembles a Python keyword is encountered, the interpreter will suggest the correct keyword in the error message. This feature helps programmers quickly identify and fix common typing mistakes. For example:

>>> whille True:
...     pass
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1
 whille True:
 ^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Did you mean 'while'? 
While the feature focuses on the most common cases, some variations of misspellings may still result in regular syntax errors. (Contributed by Pablo Galindo in [gh-132449](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132449).)

*   [`elif`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/compound_stmts.html#elif) statements that follow an [`else`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/compound_stmts.html#else) block now have a specific error message. (Contributed by Steele Farnsworth in [gh-129902](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129902).)

>>> if who == "me":
...     print("It's me!")
... else:
...     print("It's not me!")
... elif who is None:
...     print("Who is it?")
File "<stdin>", line 5
 elif who is None:
 ^^^^
SyntaxError: 'elif' block follows an 'else' block 
*   If a statement is passed to the [Conditional expressions](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/expressions.html#if-expr) after [`else`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/compound_stmts.html#else), or one of [`pass`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/simple_stmts.html#pass), [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/simple_stmts.html#break), or [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) is passed before [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/compound_stmts.html#if), then the error message highlights where the [`expression`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-python-grammar-expression) is required. (Contributed by Sergey Miryanov in [gh-129515](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129515).)

>>> x = 1 if True else pass
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1
 x = 1 if True else pass
 ^^^^
SyntaxError: expected expression after 'else', but statement is given

>>> x = continue if True else break
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1
 x = continue if True else break
 ^^^^^^^^

### [**PEP 784**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0784/): Zstandard support in the standard library[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-784-zstandard-support-in-the-standard-library "Link to this heading")

The new `compression` package contains modules `compression.lzma`, `compression.bz2`, `compression.gzip` and `compression.zlib` which re-export the [`lzma`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/lzma.html#module-lzma "lzma: A Python wrapper for the liblzma compression library."), [`bz2`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/bz2.html#module-bz2 "bz2: Interfaces for bzip2 compression and decompression."), [`gzip`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/gzip.html#module-gzip "gzip: Interfaces for gzip compression and decompression using file objects.") and [`zlib`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/zlib.html#module-zlib "zlib: Low-level interface to compression and decompression routines compatible with gzip.") modules respectively. The new import names under `compression` are the preferred names for importing these compression modules from Python 3.14. However, the existing modules names have not been deprecated. Any deprecation or removal of the existing compression modules will occur no sooner than five years after the release of 3.14.

The new `compression.zstd` module provides compression and decompression APIs for the Zstandard format via bindings to [Meta’s zstd library](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/). Zstandard is a widely adopted, highly efficient, and fast compression format. In addition to the APIs introduced in `compression.zstd`, support for reading and writing Zstandard compressed archives has been added to the [`tarfile`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/tarfile.html#module-tarfile "tarfile: Read and write tar-format archive files."), [`zipfile`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/zipfile.html#module-zipfile "zipfile: Read and write ZIP-format archive files."), and [`shutil`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/shutil.html#module-shutil "shutil: High-level file operations, including copying.") modules.

Here’s an example of using the new module to compress some data:

from compression import zstd
import math

data = str(math.pi).encode() * 20
compressed = zstd.compress(data)
ratio = len(compressed) / len(data)
print(f"Achieved compression ratio of {ratio}")

As can be seen, the API is similar to the APIs of the `lzma` and `bz2` modules.

### Asyncio introspection capabilities[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#asyncio-introspection-capabilities "Link to this heading")

Added a new command-line interface to inspect running Python processes using asynchronous tasks, available via `python -m asyncio ps PID` or `python -m asyncio pstree PID`.

The `ps` subcommand inspects the given process ID (PID) and displays information about currently running asyncio tasks. It outputs a task table: a flat listing of all tasks, their names, their coroutine stacks, and which tasks are awaiting them.

The `pstree` subcommand fetches the same information, but instead renders a visual async call tree, showing coroutine relationships in a hierarchical format. This command is particularly useful for debugging long-running or stuck asynchronous programs. It can help developers quickly identify where a program is blocked, what tasks are pending, and how coroutines are chained together.

For example given this code:

import asyncio

async def play_track(track):
    await asyncio.sleep(5)
    print(f'🎵 Finished: {track}')

async def play_album(name, tracks):
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        for track in tracks:
            tg.create_task(play_track(track), name=track)

async def main():
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        tg.create_task(
          play_album('Sundowning', ['TNDNBTG', 'Levitate']),
          name='Sundowning')
        tg.create_task(
          play_album('TMBTE', ['DYWTYLM', 'Aqua Regia']),
          name='TMBTE')

if  __name__  == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())

Executing the new tool on the running process will yield a table like this:

python -m asyncio ps 12345

tid task id task name coroutine stack awaiter chain awaiter name awaiter id

If a cycle is detected in the async await graph (which could indicate a programming issue), the tool raises an error and lists the cycle paths that prevent tree construction:

python -m asyncio pstree 12345

ERROR: await-graph contains cycles - cannot print a tree!

### Concurrent safe warnings control[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#concurrent-safe-warnings-control "Link to this heading")

The [`warnings.catch_warnings`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/warnings.html#warnings.catch_warnings "warnings.catch_warnings") context manager will now optionally use a context variable for warning filters. This is enabled by setting the [`context_aware_warnings`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.html#sys.flags.context_aware_warnings "sys.flags.context_aware_warnings") flag, either with the `-X` command-line option or an environment variable. This gives predictable warnings control when using [`catch_warnings`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/warnings.html#warnings.catch_warnings "warnings.catch_warnings") combined with multiple threads or asynchronous tasks. The flag defaults to true for the free-threaded build and false for the GIL-enabled build.

Other language changes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#other-language-changes "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   All Windows code pages are now supported as ‘cpXXX’ codecs on Windows. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-123803](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123803).)

*   Implement mixed-mode arithmetic rules combining real and complex numbers as specified by the C standard since C99. (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in [gh-69639](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/69639).)

*   More syntax errors are now detected regardless of optimisation and the [`-O`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-O) command-line option. This includes writes to `__debug__`, incorrect use of [`await`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/expressions.html#await), and asynchronous comprehensions outside asynchronous functions. For example, `python -O -c 'assert (__debug__ := 1)'` or `python -O -c 'assert await 1'` now produce [`SyntaxError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError "SyntaxError")s. (Contributed by Irit Katriel and Jelle Zijlstra in [gh-122245](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122245)&[gh-121637](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121637).)

*   When subclassing a pure C type, the C slots for the new type are no longer replaced with a wrapped version on class creation if they are not explicitly overridden in the subclass. (Contributed by Tomasz Pytel in [gh-132284](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132284).)

### Built-ins[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#built-ins "Link to this heading")

*   The [`bytes.fromhex()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.fromhex "bytes.fromhex") and [`bytearray.fromhex()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray.fromhex "bytearray.fromhex") methods now accept ASCII [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") and [bytes-like objects](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-bytes-like-object). (Contributed by Daniel Pope in [gh-129349](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129349).)

*   Add class methods [`float.from_number()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#float.from_number "float.from_number") and [`complex.from_number()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#complex.from_number "complex.from_number") to convert a number to [`float`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#float "float") or [`complex`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#complex "complex") type correspondingly. They raise a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") if the argument is not a real number. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-84978](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84978).)

*   Support underscore and comma as thousands separators in the fractional part for floating-point presentation types of the new-style string formatting (with [`format()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#format "format") or [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings)). (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in [gh-87790](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87790).)

*   The [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#int "int") function no longer delegates to [`__trunc__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/datamodel.html#object.__trunc__ "object.__trunc__"). Classes that want to support conversion to `int()` must implement either [`__int__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/datamodel.html#object.__int__ "object.__int__") or [`__index__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/datamodel.html#object.__index__ "object.__index__"). (Contributed by Mark Dickinson in [gh-119743](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119743).)

*   The [`map()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#map "map") function now has an optional keyword-only _strict_ flag like [`zip()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#zip "zip") to check that all the iterables are of equal length. (Contributed by Wannes Boeykens in [gh-119793](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119793).)

*   The [`memoryview`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview") type now supports subscription, making it a [generic type](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-generic-type).

*   Using [`NotImplemented`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented") in a boolean context will now raise a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError"). This has raised a [`DeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") since Python 3.9. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in [gh-118767](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118767).)

*   Three-argument [`pow()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#pow "pow") now tries calling [`__rpow__()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/datamodel.html#object.__rpow__ "object.__rpow__") if necessary. Previously it was only called in two-argument `pow()` and the binary power operator. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-130104](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130104).)

*   [`super`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#super "super") objects are now [`copyable`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/copy.html#module-copy "copy: Shallow and deep copy operations.") and [`pickleable`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back."). (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-125767](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125767).)

### Command line and environment[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#command-line-and-environment "Link to this heading")

*   The import time flag can now track modules that are already loaded (‘cached’), via the new [`-X importtime=2`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-X). When such a module is imported, the `self` and `cumulative` times are replaced by the string `cached`.

Values above `2` for `-X importtime` are now reserved for future use.

(Contributed by Noah Kim and Adam Turner in [gh-118655](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118655).)

*   The command-line option [`-c`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c) now automatically dedents its code argument before execution. The auto-dedentation behavior mirrors [`textwrap.dedent()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/textwrap.html#textwrap.dedent "textwrap.dedent"). (Contributed by Jon Crall and Steven Sun in [gh-103998](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103998).)

*   `-J` is no longer a reserved flag for [Jython](https://www.jython.org/), and now has no special meaning. (Contributed by Adam Turner in [gh-133336](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133336).)

### PEP 758: Allow `except` and `except*` expressions without brackets[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-758-allow-except-and-except-expressions-without-brackets "Link to this heading")

The [`except`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/compound_stmts.html#except) and [`except*`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/compound_stmts.html#except-star) expressions now allow brackets to be omitted when there are multiple exception types and the `as` clause is not used. For example:

try:
    connect_to_server()
except TimeoutError, ConnectionRefusedError:
    print('The network has ceased to be!')

(Contributed by Pablo Galindo and Brett Cannon in [**PEP 758**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0758/) and [gh-131831](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131831).)

### PEP 765: Control flow in [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) blocks[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-765-control-flow-in-finally-blocks "Link to this heading")

The compiler now emits a [`SyntaxWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxWarning "SyntaxWarning") when a [`return`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/simple_stmts.html#return), [`break`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/simple_stmts.html#break), or [`continue`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue) statement have the effect of leaving a [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) block. This change is specified in [**PEP 765**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0765/).

In situations where this change is inconvenient (such as those where the warnings are redundant due to code linting), the [warning filter](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/warnings.html#warning-filter) can be used to turn off all syntax warnings by adding `ignore::SyntaxWarning` as a filter. This can be specified in combination with a filter that converts other warnings to errors (for example, passing `-Werror -Wignore::SyntaxWarning` as CLI options, or setting `PYTHONWARNINGS=error,ignore::SyntaxWarning`).

Note that applying such a filter at runtime using the [`warnings`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/warnings.html#module-warnings "warnings: Issue warning messages and control their disposition.") module will only suppress the warning in code that is compiled _after_ the filter is adjusted. Code that is compiled prior to the filter adjustment (for example, when a module is imported) will still emit the syntax warning.

(Contributed by Irit Katriel in [gh-130080](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130080).)

### Incremental garbage collection[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#incremental-garbage-collection "Link to this heading")

The cycle garbage collector is now incremental. This means that maximum pause times are reduced by an order of magnitude or more for larger heaps.

There are now only two generations: young and old. When [`gc.collect()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/gc.html#gc.collect "gc.collect") is not called directly, the GC is invoked a little less frequently. When invoked, it collects the young generation and an increment of the old generation, instead of collecting one or more generations.

The behavior of `gc.collect()` changes slightly:

*   `gc.collect(1)`: Performs an increment of garbage collection, rather than collecting generation 1.

*   Other calls to `gc.collect()` are unchanged.

(Contributed by Mark Shannon in [gh-108362](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/108362).)

### Default interactive shell[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#default-interactive-shell "Link to this heading")

*   The default [interactive](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-interactive) shell now highlights Python syntax. The feature is enabled by default, save if [`PYTHON_BASIC_REPL`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_BASIC_REPL) or any other environment variable that disables colour is set. See [Controlling color](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#using-on-controlling-color) for details.

The default color theme for syntax highlighting strives for good contrast and exclusively uses the 4-bit VGA standard ANSI color codes for maximum compatibility. The theme can be customized using an experimental API `_colorize.set_theme()`. This can be called interactively or in the [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP) script. Note that this function has no stability guarantees, and may change or be removed.

(Contributed by Łukasz Langa in [gh-131507](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131507).)

*   The default [interactive](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-interactive) shell now supports import auto-completion. This means that typing `import co` and pressing <Tab> will suggest modules starting with `co`. Similarly, typing `from concurrent import i` will suggest submodules of `concurrent` starting with `i`. Note that autocompletion of module attributes is not currently supported. (Contributed by Tomas Roun in [gh-69605](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/69605).)

*   The default value of the [program name](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/argparse.html#prog) for [`argparse.ArgumentParser`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser "argparse.ArgumentParser") now reflects the way the Python interpreter was instructed to find the `__main__` module code. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka and Alyssa Coghlan in [gh-66436](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/66436).)

*   Introduced the optional _suggest\_on\_error_ parameter to [`argparse.ArgumentParser`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser "argparse.ArgumentParser"), enabling suggestions for argument choices and subparser names if mistyped by the user. (Contributed by Savannah Ostrowski in [gh-124456](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124456).)

*   Enable color for help text, which can be disabled with the optional _color_ parameter to [`argparse.ArgumentParser`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser "argparse.ArgumentParser"). This can also be controlled by [environment variables](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#using-on-controlling-color). (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-130645](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130645).)

### ast[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#ast "Link to this heading")

*   Add [`compare()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ast.html#ast.compare "ast.compare"), a function for comparing two ASTs. (Contributed by Batuhan Taskaya and Jeremy Hylton in [gh-60191](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/60191).)

*   Add support for [`copy.replace()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/copy.html#copy.replace "copy.replace") for AST nodes. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in [gh-121141](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121141).)

*   Docstrings are now removed from an optimized AST in optimization level 2. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in [gh-123958](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123958).)

*   The [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#repr "repr") output for AST nodes now includes more information. (Contributed by Tomas Roun in [gh-116022](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116022).)

*   When called with an AST as input, the [`parse()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ast.html#ast.parse "ast.parse") function now always verifies that the root node type is appropriate. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in [gh-130139](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130139).)

*   Add new options to the command-line interface: [`--feature-version`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ast.html#cmdoption-ast-feature-version), [`--optimize`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ast.html#cmdoption-ast-optimize), and [`--show-empty`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ast.html#cmdoption-ast-show-empty). (Contributed by Semyon Moroz in [gh-133367](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133367).)

### asyncio[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#asyncio "Link to this heading")

*   The function and methods named `create_task()` now take an arbitrary list of keyword arguments. All keyword arguments are passed to the [`Task`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task") constructor or the custom task factory. (See [`set_task_factory()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.set_task_factory "asyncio.loop.set_task_factory") for details.) The `name` and `context` keyword arguments are no longer special; the name should now be set using the `name` keyword argument of the factory, and `context` may be `None`.

This affects the following function and methods: [`asyncio.create_task()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.create_task "asyncio.create_task"), [`asyncio.loop.create_task()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.create_task "asyncio.loop.create_task"), [`asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task "asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task").

(Contributed by Thomas Grainger in [gh-128307](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128307).)

*   There are two new utility functions for introspecting and printing a program’s call graph: [`capture_call_graph()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-graph.html#asyncio.capture_call_graph "asyncio.capture_call_graph") and [`print_call_graph()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-graph.html#asyncio.print_call_graph "asyncio.print_call_graph"). See [Asyncio introspection capabilities](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-asyncio-introspection) for more details. (Contributed by Yury Selivanov, Pablo Galindo Salgado, and Łukasz Langa in [gh-91048](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91048).)

### calendar[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#calendar "Link to this heading")

*   By default, today’s date is highlighted in color in [`calendar`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/calendar.html#module-calendar "calendar: Functions for working with calendars, including some emulation of the Unix cal program.")’s [command-line](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/calendar.html#calendar-cli) text output. This can be controlled by [environment variables](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#using-on-controlling-color). (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-128317](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128317).)

### concurrent.futures[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#concurrent-futures "Link to this heading")

*   Add a new executor class, [`InterpreterPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor"), which exposes multiple Python interpreters in the same process (‘subinterpreters’) to Python code. This uses a pool of independent Python interpreters to execute calls asynchronously.

This is separate from the new [`interpreters`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/concurrent.interpreters.html#module-concurrent.interpreters "concurrent.interpreters: Multiple interpreters in the same process") module introduced by [PEP 734](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-multiple-interpreters). (Contributed by Eric Snow in [gh-124548](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124548).)

*   On Unix platforms other than macOS, [‘forkserver’](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-forkserver) is now the default [start method](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-methods) for [`ProcessPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor") (replacing [‘fork’](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-fork)). This change does not affect Windows or macOS, where [‘spawn’](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-spawn) remains the default start method.

If the threading incompatible _fork_ method is required, you must explicitly request it by supplying a multiprocessing context _mp\_context_ to [`ProcessPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor").

See [forkserver restrictions](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-programming-forkserver) for information and differences with the _fork_ method and how this change may affect existing code with mutable global shared variables and/or shared objects that can not be automatically [`pickled`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.").

(Contributed by Gregory P. Smith in [gh-84559](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84559).)

*   Add two new methods to [`ProcessPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor"), [`terminate_workers()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.terminate_workers "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.terminate_workers") and [`kill_workers()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.kill_workers "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.kill_workers"), as ways to terminate or kill all living worker processes in the given pool. (Contributed by Charles Machalow in [gh-130849](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130849).)

*   Add the optional _buffersize_ parameter to [`Executor.map`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.Executor.map "concurrent.futures.Executor.map") to limit the number of submitted tasks whose results have not yet been yielded. If the buffer is full, iteration over the _iterables_ pauses until a result is yielded from the buffer. (Contributed by Enzo Bonnal and Josh Rosenberg in [gh-74028](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/74028).)

### configparser[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#configparser "Link to this heading")

*   `configparser` will no longer write config files it cannot read, to improve security. Attempting to [`write()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/configparser.html#configparser.ConfigParser.write "configparser.ConfigParser.write") keys containing delimiters or beginning with the section header pattern will raise an [`InvalidWriteError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/configparser.html#configparser.InvalidWriteError "configparser.InvalidWriteError"). (Contributed by Jacob Lincoln in [gh-129270](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129270).)

### contextvars[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#contextvars "Link to this heading")

*   Support the [context manager](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-context-manager) protocol for [`Token`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/contextvars.html#contextvars.Token "contextvars.Token") objects. (Contributed by Andrew Svetlov in [gh-129889](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129889).)

### ctypes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#ctypes "Link to this heading")

*   The layout of [bit fields](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes-bit-fields-in-structures-unions) in [`Structure`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure "ctypes.Structure") and [`Union`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Union "ctypes.Union") objects is now a closer match to platform defaults (GCC/Clang or MSVC). In particular, fields no longer overlap. (Contributed by Matthias Görgens in [gh-97702](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97702).)

*   The [`Structure._layout_`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure._layout_ "ctypes.Structure._layout_") class attribute can now be set to help match a non-default ABI. (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in [gh-97702](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97702).)

*   The class of [`Structure`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure "ctypes.Structure")/[`Union`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Union "ctypes.Union") field descriptors is now available as [`CField`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.CField "ctypes.CField"), and has new attributes to aid debugging and introspection. (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in [gh-128715](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128715).)

*   On Windows, the [`COMError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.COMError "ctypes.COMError") exception is now public. (Contributed by Jun Komoda in [gh-126686](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126686).)

*   On Windows, the [`CopyComPointer()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.CopyComPointer "ctypes.CopyComPointer") function is now public. (Contributed by Jun Komoda in [gh-127275](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127275).)

*   Add [`memoryview_at()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.memoryview_at "ctypes.memoryview_at"), a function to create a [`memoryview`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview") object that refers to the supplied pointer and length. This works like [`ctypes.string_at()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.string_at "ctypes.string_at") except it avoids a buffer copy, and is typically useful when implementing pure Python callback functions that are passed dynamically-sized buffers. (Contributed by Rian Hunter in [gh-112018](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112018).)

*   Complex types, [`c_float_complex`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_float_complex "ctypes.c_float_complex"), [`c_double_complex`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_double_complex "ctypes.c_double_complex"), and [`c_longdouble_complex`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.c_longdouble_complex "ctypes.c_longdouble_complex"), are now available if both the compiler and the `libffi` library support complex C types. (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in [gh-61103](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/61103).)

*   Add [`ctypes.util.dllist()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.util.dllist "ctypes.util.dllist") for listing the shared libraries loaded by the current process. (Contributed by Brian Ward in [gh-119349](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119349).)

*   Move [`ctypes.POINTER()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.POINTER "ctypes.POINTER") types cache from a global internal cache (`_pointer_type_cache`) to the [`_CData.__pointer_type__`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes._CData.__pointer_type__ "ctypes._CData.__pointer_type__") attribute of the corresponding `ctypes` types. This will stop the cache from growing without limits in some situations. (Contributed by Sergey Miryanov in [gh-100926](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100926).)

*   The [`py_object`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.py_object "ctypes.py_object") type now supports subscription, making it a [generic type](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-generic-type). (Contributed by Brian Schubert in [gh-132168](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132168).)

*   `ctypes` now supports [free-threading builds](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-free-threading). (Contributed by Kumar Aditya and Peter Bierma in [gh-127945](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127945).)

### curses[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#curses "Link to this heading")

*   Add the [`assume_default_colors()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/curses.html#curses.assume_default_colors "curses.assume_default_colors") function, a refinement of the [`use_default_colors()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/curses.html#curses.use_default_colors "curses.use_default_colors") function which allows changing the color pair `0`. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-133139](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133139).)

### datetime[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#datetime "Link to this heading")

*   Add the [`strptime()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.strptime "datetime.date.strptime") method to the [`datetime.date`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/datetime.html#datetime.date "datetime.date") and [`datetime.time`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/datetime.html#datetime.time "datetime.time") classes. (Contributed by Wannes Boeykens in [gh-41431](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/41431).)

### decimal[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#decimal "Link to this heading")

(Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-121798](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121798).)

*   Expose [`IEEEContext()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/decimal.html#decimal.IEEEContext "decimal.IEEEContext") to support creation of contexts corresponding to the IEEE 754 (2008) decimal interchange formats. (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in [gh-53032](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/53032).)

### difflib[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#difflib "Link to this heading")

*   Comparison pages with highlighted changes generated by the [`HtmlDiff`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/difflib.html#difflib.HtmlDiff "difflib.HtmlDiff") class now support ‘dark mode’. (Contributed by Jiahao Li in [gh-129939](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129939).)

### dis[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#dis "Link to this heading")

*   Add support for rendering full source location information of [`instructions`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/dis.html#dis.Instruction "dis.Instruction"), rather than only the line number. This feature is added to the following interfaces via the _show\_positions_ keyword argument:

*   Add [`Fraction.from_number()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/fractions.html#fractions.Fraction.from_number "fractions.Fraction.from_number") as an alternative constructor for [`Fraction`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/fractions.html#fractions.Fraction "fractions.Fraction"). (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-121797](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121797).)

### functools[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#functools "Link to this heading")

*   Add the [`Placeholder`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functools.html#functools.Placeholder "functools.Placeholder") sentinel. This may be used with the [`partial()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functools.html#functools.partial "functools.partial") or [`partialmethod()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functools.html#functools.partialmethod "functools.partialmethod") functions to reserve a place for positional arguments in the returned [partial object](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functools.html#partial-objects). (Contributed by Dominykas Grigonis in [gh-119127](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119127).)

(Contributed by Yorik Hansen in [gh-123430](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123430).)

*   The [`http.server`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/http.server.html#module-http.server "http.server: HTTP server and request handlers.") module now supports serving over HTTPS using the [`http.server.HTTPSServer`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/http.server.html#http.server.HTTPSServer "http.server.HTTPSServer") class. This functionality is exposed by the command-line interface (`python -m http.server`) through the following options:

    *   [`--tls-cert <path>`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/http.server.html#cmdoption-http.server-tls-cert): Path to the TLS certificate file.

    *   [`--tls-key <path>`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/http.server.html#cmdoption-http.server-tls-key): Optional path to the private key file.

    *   [`--tls-password-file <path>`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/http.server.html#cmdoption-http.server-tls-password-file): Optional path to the password file for the private key.

(Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in [gh-101552](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101552).)

*   [`Signature.format()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/inspect.html#inspect.Signature.format "inspect.Signature.format") takes a new argument _unquote\_annotations_. If true, string [annotations](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-annotation) are displayed without surrounding quotes. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in [gh-101552](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101552).)

*   Add function [`ispackage()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/inspect.html#inspect.ispackage "inspect.ispackage") to determine whether an object is a [package](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-package) or not. (Contributed by Zhikang Yan in [gh-125634](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125634).)

### io[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#io "Link to this heading")

*   Reading text from a non-blocking stream with `read` may now raise a [`BlockingIOError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#BlockingIOError "BlockingIOError") if the operation cannot immediately return bytes. (Contributed by Giovanni Siragusa in [gh-109523](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109523).)

*   Add the [`Reader`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/io.html#io.Reader "io.Reader") and [`Writer`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/io.html#io.Writer "io.Writer") protocols as simpler alternatives to the pseudo-protocols [`typing.IO`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.IO "typing.IO"), [`typing.TextIO`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.TextIO "typing.TextIO"), and [`typing.BinaryIO`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.BinaryIO "typing.BinaryIO"). (Contributed by Sebastian Rittau in [gh-127648](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127648).)

### json[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#json "Link to this heading")

*   Add exception notes for JSON serialization errors that allow identifying the source of the error. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-122163](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122163).)

*   Allow using the [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/json.html#module-json "json: Encode and decode the JSON format.") module as a script using the [`-m`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-m) switch: **python -m json**. This is now preferred to **python -m json.tool**, which is [soft deprecated](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-soft-deprecated). See the [JSON command-line interface](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/json.html#json-commandline) documentation. (Contributed by Trey Hunner in [gh-122873](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122873).)

*   By default, the output of the [JSON command-line interface](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/json.html#json-commandline) is highlighted in color. This can be controlled by [environment variables](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#using-on-controlling-color). (Contributed by Tomas Roun in [gh-131952](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131952).)

*   [`QueueListener`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.QueueListener "logging.handlers.QueueListener") objects now support the [context manager](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-context-manager) protocol. (Contributed by Charles Machalow in [gh-132106](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132106).)

*   [`QueueListener.start`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.QueueListener.start "logging.handlers.QueueListener.start") now raises a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") if the listener is already started. (Contributed by Charles Machalow in [gh-132106](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132106).)

### math[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#math "Link to this heading")

*   Added more detailed error messages for domain errors in the module. (Contributed by Charlie Zhao and Sergey B Kirpichev in [gh-101410](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101410).)

### mimetypes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#mimetypes "Link to this heading")

*   Add a public [command-line](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/mimetypes.html#mimetypes-cli) for the module, invoked via **python -m mimetypes**. (Contributed by Oleg Iarygin and Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-93096](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93096).)

### multiprocessing[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#multiprocessing "Link to this heading")

*   On Unix platforms other than macOS, [‘forkserver’](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-forkserver) is now the default [start method](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-methods) (replacing [‘fork’](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-fork)). This change does not affect Windows or macOS, where [‘spawn’](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-spawn) remains the default start method.

If the threading incompatible _fork_ method is required, you must explicitly request it via a context from [`get_context()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.get_context "multiprocessing.get_context") (preferred) or change the default via [`set_start_method()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.set_start_method "multiprocessing.set_start_method").

See [forkserver restrictions](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-programming-forkserver) for information and differences with the _fork_ method and how this change may affect existing code with mutable global shared variables and/or shared objects that can not be automatically [`pickled`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back.").

(Contributed by Gregory P. Smith in [gh-84559](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/84559).)

*   [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism.")’s `'forkserver'` start method now authenticates its control socket to avoid solely relying on filesystem permissions to restrict what other processes could cause the forkserver to spawn workers and run code. (Contributed by Gregory P. Smith for [gh-97514](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97514).)

*   The [multiprocessing proxy objects](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-proxy-objects) for _list_ and _dict_ types gain previously overlooked missing methods:

> *   `clear()` and `copy()` for proxies of [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#list "list")
> 
>     *   [`fromkeys()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#dict.fromkeys "dict.fromkeys"), `reversed(d)`, `d | {}`, `{} | d`, `d |= {'b': 2}` for proxies of [`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#dict "dict")

(Contributed by Roy Hyunjin Han for [gh-103134](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103134).)

*   Add support for shared [`set`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#set "set") objects via [`SyncManager.set()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.set "multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager.set"). The [`set()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#set "set") in [`Manager()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Manager "multiprocessing.Manager") method is now available. (Contributed by Mingyu Park in [gh-129949](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129949).)

*   Add the [`interrupt()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Process.interrupt "multiprocessing.Process.interrupt") to [`multiprocessing.Process`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Process "multiprocessing.Process") objects, which terminates the child process by sending [`SIGINT`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/signal.html#signal.SIGINT "signal.SIGINT"). This enables [`finally`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/compound_stmts.html#finally) clauses to print a stack trace for the terminated process. (Contributed by Artem Pulkin in [gh-131913](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131913).)

### operator[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#operator "Link to this heading")

*   Add [`is_none()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/operator.html#operator.is_none "operator.is_none") and [`is_not_none()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/operator.html#operator.is_not_none "operator.is_not_none") as a pair of functions, such that `operator.is_none(obj)` is equivalent to `obj is None` and `operator.is_not_none(obj)` is equivalent to `obj is not None`. (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger and Nico Mexis in [gh-115808](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115808).)

### os[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#os "Link to this heading")

*   Add the [`reload_environ()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/os.html#os.reload_environ "os.reload_environ") function to update [`os.environ`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/os.html#os.environ "os.environ") and [`os.environb`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/os.html#os.environb "os.environb") with changes to the environment made by [`os.putenv()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/os.html#os.putenv "os.putenv"), by [`os.unsetenv()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/os.html#os.unsetenv "os.unsetenv"), or made outside Python in the same process. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [gh-120057](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120057).)

*   Add the [`SCHED_DEADLINE`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/os.html#os.SCHED_DEADLINE "os.SCHED_DEADLINE") and [`SCHED_NORMAL`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/os.html#os.SCHED_NORMAL "os.SCHED_NORMAL") constants to the `os` module. (Contributed by James Roy in [gh-127688](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127688).)

*   Add the [`readinto()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/os.html#os.readinto "os.readinto") function to read into a [buffer object](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/buffer.html#bufferobjects) from a file descriptor. (Contributed by Cody Maloney in [gh-129205](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129205).)

### os.path[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#os-path "Link to this heading")

*   The _strict_ parameter to [`realpath()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/os.path.html#os.path.realpath "os.path.realpath") accepts a new value, [`ALLOW_MISSING`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/os.path.html#os.path.ALLOW_MISSING "os.path.ALLOW_MISSING"). If used, errors other than [`FileNotFoundError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#FileNotFoundError "FileNotFoundError") will be re-raised; the resulting path can be missing but it will be free of symlinks. (Contributed by Petr Viktorin for [**CVE 2025-4517**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4517).)

### pathlib[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pathlib "Link to this heading")

*   Add methods to [`pathlib.Path`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path "pathlib.Path") to recursively copy or move files and directories:

    *   [`copy()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.copy "pathlib.Path.copy") copies a file or directory tree to a destination.

    *   [`copy_into()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.copy_into "pathlib.Path.copy_into") copies _into_ a destination directory.

    *   [`move()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.move "pathlib.Path.move") moves a file or directory tree to a destination.

    *   [`move_into()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.move_into "pathlib.Path.move_into") moves _into_ a destination directory.

(Contributed by Barney Gale in [gh-73991](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/73991).)

*   Add the [`info`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.info "pathlib.Path.info") attribute, which stores an object implementing the new [`pathlib.types.PathInfo`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.types.PathInfo "pathlib.types.PathInfo") protocol. The object supports querying the file type and internally caching [`stat()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/os.html#os.stat "os.stat") results. Path objects generated by [`iterdir()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.iterdir "pathlib.Path.iterdir") are initialized with file type information gleaned from scanning the parent directory. (Contributed by Barney Gale in [gh-125413](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125413).)

### pdb[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pdb "Link to this heading")

*   The [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") module now supports remote attaching to a running Python process using a new [`-p PID`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#cmdoption-pdb-p) command-line option:

python -m pdb -p 1234 
This will connect to the Python process with the given PID and allow you to debug it interactively. Notice that due to how the Python interpreter works attaching to a remote process that is blocked in a system call or waiting for I/O will only work once the next bytecode instruction is executed or when the process receives a signal.

This feature uses [PEP 768](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-remote-debugging) and the new [`sys.remote_exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.html#sys.remote_exec "sys.remote_exec") function to attach to the remote process and send the PDB commands to it.

(Contributed by Matt Wozniski and Pablo Galindo in [gh-131591](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131591).)

*   Hardcoded breakpoints ([`breakpoint()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#breakpoint "breakpoint") and [`set_trace()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#pdb.set_trace "pdb.set_trace")) now reuse the most recent [`Pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#pdb.Pdb "pdb.Pdb") instance that calls [`set_trace()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#pdb.Pdb.set_trace "pdb.Pdb.set_trace"), instead of creating a new one each time. As a result, all the instance specific data like [`display`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#pdbcommand-display) and [`commands`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#pdbcommand-commands) are preserved across hardcoded breakpoints. (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-121450](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121450).)

*   Add a new argument _mode_ to [`pdb.Pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#pdb.Pdb "pdb.Pdb"). Disable the `restart` command when [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") is in `inline` mode. (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-123757](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123757).)

*   A confirmation prompt will be shown when the user tries to quit [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") in `inline` mode. `y`, `Y`, `<Enter>` or `EOF` will confirm the quit and call [`sys.exit()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.html#sys.exit "sys.exit"), instead of raising [`bdb.BdbQuit`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/bdb.html#bdb.BdbQuit "bdb.BdbQuit"). (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-124704](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124704).)

*   Inline breakpoints like [`breakpoint()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#breakpoint "breakpoint") or [`pdb.set_trace()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#pdb.set_trace "pdb.set_trace") will always stop the program at calling frame, ignoring the `skip` pattern (if any). (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-130493](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130493).)

*   `<tab>` at the beginning of the line in [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") multi-line input will fill in a 4-space indentation now, instead of inserting a `\t` character. (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-130471](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130471).)

*   Auto-indent is introduced in [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") multi-line input. It will either keep the indentation of the last line or insert a 4-space indentation when it detects a new code block.

### types[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#types "Link to this heading")

*   [`types.UnionType`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/types.html#types.UnionType "types.UnionType") is now an alias for [`typing.Union`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.Union "typing.Union"). See [below](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-typing-union) for more details. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in [gh-105499](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105499).)

### typing[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#typing "Link to this heading")

*   The [`types.UnionType`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/types.html#types.UnionType "types.UnionType") and [`typing.Union`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.Union "typing.Union") types are now aliases for each other, meaning that both old-style unions (created with `Union[int, str]`) and new-style unions (`int | str`) now create instances of the same runtime type. This unifies the behavior between the two syntaxes, but leads to some differences in behavior that may affect users who introspect types at runtime:

    *   Both syntaxes for creating a union now produce the same string representation in [`repr()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#repr "repr"). For example, `repr(Union[int, str])` is now `"int | str"` instead of `"typing.Union[int, str]"`.

    *   Unions created using the old syntax are no longer cached. Previously, running `Union[int, str]` multiple times would return the same object (`Union[int, str] is Union[int, str]` would be `True`), but now it will return two different objects. Use `==` to compare unions for equality, not `is`. New-style unions have never been cached this way. This change could increase memory usage for some programs that use a large number of unions created by subscripting `typing.Union`. However, several factors offset this cost: unions used in annotations are no longer evaluated by default in Python 3.14 because of [**PEP 649**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/); an instance of [`types.UnionType`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/types.html#types.UnionType "types.UnionType") is itself much smaller than the object returned by `Union[]` was on prior Python versions; and removing the cache also saves some space. It is therefore unlikely that this change will cause a significant increase in memory usage for most users.

    *   Previously, old-style unions were implemented using the private class `typing._UnionGenericAlias`. This class is no longer needed for the implementation, but it has been retained for backward compatibility, with removal scheduled for Python 3.17. Users should use documented introspection helpers like [`get_origin()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.get_origin "typing.get_origin") and [`typing.get_args()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.get_args "typing.get_args") instead of relying on private implementation details.

    *   It is now possible to use [`typing.Union`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.Union "typing.Union") itself in [`isinstance()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#isinstance "isinstance") checks. For example, `isinstance(int | str, typing.Union)` will return `True`; previously this raised [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").

    *   The `__args__` attribute of [`typing.Union`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.Union "typing.Union") objects is no longer writable.

    *   It is no longer possible to set any attributes on [`Union`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.Union "typing.Union") objects. This only ever worked for dunder attributes on previous versions, was never documented to work, and was subtly broken in many cases.

*   [`TypeAliasType`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.TypeAliasType "typing.TypeAliasType") now supports star unpacking.

This can be controlled by [environment variables](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#using-on-controlling-color). (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-127221](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127221).)

*   unittest discovery supports [namespace package](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-namespace-package) as start directory again. It was removed in Python 3.11. (Contributed by Jacob Walls in [gh-80958](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/80958).)

*   A number of new methods were added in the [`TestCase`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase "unittest.TestCase") class that provide more specialized tests.

    *   [`assertHasAttr()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertHasAttr "unittest.TestCase.assertHasAttr") and [`assertNotHasAttr()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertNotHasAttr "unittest.TestCase.assertNotHasAttr") check whether the object has a particular attribute.

    *   [`assertIsSubclass()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertIsSubclass "unittest.TestCase.assertIsSubclass") and [`assertNotIsSubclass()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertNotIsSubclass "unittest.TestCase.assertNotIsSubclass") check whether the object is a subclass of a particular class, or of one of a tuple of classes.

    *   Accept a complete URL when the new _require\_scheme_ argument is set to true.

    *   Discard URL authority if it matches the local hostname.

    *   Discard URL authority if it resolves to a local IP address when the new _resolve\_host_ argument is set to true.

    *   Discard URL query and fragment components.

    *   Raise [`URLError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/urllib.error.html#urllib.error.URLError "urllib.error.URLError") if a URL authority isn’t local, except on Windows where we return a UNC path as before.

In [`pathname2url()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.pathname2url "urllib.request.pathname2url"):

    *   Return a complete URL when the new _add\_scheme_ argument is set to true.

    *   Include an empty URL authority when a path begins with a slash. For example, the path `/etc/hosts` is converted to the URL `///etc/hosts`.

On Windows, drive letters are no longer converted to uppercase, and `:` characters not following a drive letter no longer cause an [`OSError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#OSError "OSError") exception to be raised.

*   Allow generating multiple UUIDs simultaneously on the command-line via [`python -m uuid --count`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/uuid.html#cmdoption-uuid-count). (Contributed by Simon Legner in [gh-131236](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/131236).)

### webbrowser[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#webbrowser "Link to this heading")

*   Names in the `BROWSER` environment variable can now refer to already registered browsers for the [`webbrowser`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/webbrowser.html#module-webbrowser "webbrowser: Easy-to-use controller for web browsers.") module, instead of always generating a new browser command.

This makes it possible to set `BROWSER` to the value of one of the supported browsers on macOS.

### zipfile[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#zipfile "Link to this heading")

*   Added [`ZipInfo._for_archive`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipInfo._for_archive "zipfile.ZipInfo._for_archive"), a method to resolve suitable defaults for a [`ZipInfo`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipInfo "zipfile.ZipInfo") object as used by [`ZipFile.writestr`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.writestr "zipfile.ZipFile.writestr"). (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in [gh-123424](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/123424).)

*   [`ZipFile.writestr()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.writestr "zipfile.ZipFile.writestr") now respects the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment variable in order to better support reproducible builds. (Contributed by Jiahao Li in [gh-91279](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91279).)

Optimizations[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#optimizations "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   The import time for several standard library modules has been improved, including [`annotationlib`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/annotationlib.html#module-annotationlib "annotationlib: Functionality for introspecting annotations"), [`ast`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ast.html#module-ast "ast: Abstract Syntax Tree classes and manipulation."), [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O."), [`base64`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/base64.html#module-base64 "base64: RFC 4648: Base16, Base32, Base64 Data Encodings; Base85 and Ascii85"), [`cmd`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/cmd.html#module-cmd "cmd: Build line-oriented command interpreters."), [`csv`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/csv.html#module-csv "csv: Write and read tabular data to and from delimited files."), [`gettext`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/gettext.html#module-gettext "gettext: Multilingual internationalization services."), [`importlib.util`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/importlib.html#module-importlib.util "importlib.util: Utility code for importers"), [`locale`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/locale.html#module-locale "locale: Internationalization services."), [`mimetypes`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/mimetypes.html#module-mimetypes "mimetypes: Mapping of filename extensions to MIME types."), [`optparse`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/optparse.html#module-optparse "optparse: Command-line option parsing library."), [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pickle.html#module-pickle "pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back."), [`pprint`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pprint.html#module-pprint "pprint: Data pretty printer."), [`pstats`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/profile.html#module-pstats "pstats: Statistics object for use with the profiler."), [`shlex`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/shlex.html#module-shlex "shlex: Simple lexical analysis for Unix shell-like languages."), [`socket`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/socket.html#module-socket "socket: Low-level networking interface."), [`string`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/string.html#module-string "string: Common string operations."), [`subprocess`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess "subprocess: Subprocess management."), [`threading`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism."), [`tomllib`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/tomllib.html#module-tomllib "tomllib: Parse TOML files."), [`types`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/types.html#module-types "types: Names for built-in types."), and [`zipfile`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/zipfile.html#module-zipfile "zipfile: Read and write ZIP-format archive files.").

*   The interpreter now avoids some reference count modifications internally when it’s safe to do so. This can lead to different values being returned from [`sys.getrefcount()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.html#sys.getrefcount "sys.getrefcount") and [`Py_REFCNT()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_REFCNT "Py_REFCNT") compared to previous versions of Python. See [below](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-refcount) for details.

### asyncio[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#id2 "Link to this heading")

*   Standard benchmark results have improved by 10-20% following the implementation of a new per-thread doubly linked list for [`native tasks`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task "asyncio.Task"), also reducing memory usage. This enables external introspection tools such as [python -m asyncio pstree](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-asyncio-introspection) to introspect the call graph of asyncio tasks running in all threads. (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in [gh-107803](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/107803).)

*   The module now has first class support for [free-threading builds](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-free-threading). This enables parallel execution of multiple event loops across different threads, scaling linearly with the number of threads. (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in [gh-128002](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128002).)

### base64[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#base64 "Link to this heading")

*   [`b16decode()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/base64.html#base64.b16decode "base64.b16decode") is now up to six times faster. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran, Chris Markiewicz, and Adam Turner in [gh-118761](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118761).)

### bdb[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#bdb "Link to this heading")

*   The basic debugger now has a [`sys.monitoring`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.monitoring.html#module-sys.monitoring "sys.monitoring: Access and control event monitoring")-based backend, which can be selected via the passing `'monitoring'` to the [`Bdb`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/bdb.html#bdb.Bdb "bdb.Bdb") class’s new _backend_ parameter. (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-124533](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124533).)

### difflib[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#id3 "Link to this heading")

*   The [`IS_LINE_JUNK()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/difflib.html#difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK "difflib.IS_LINE_JUNK") function is now up to twice as fast. (Contributed by Adam Turner and Semyon Moroz in [gh-130167](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130167).)

### gc[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#gc "Link to this heading")

*   The new [incremental garbage collector](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-incremental-gc) means that maximum pause times are reduced by an order of magnitude or more for larger heaps.

Because of this optimization, the meaning of the results of [`get_threshold()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/gc.html#gc.get_threshold "gc.get_threshold") and [`set_threshold()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/gc.html#gc.set_threshold "gc.set_threshold") have changed, along with [`get_count()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/gc.html#gc.get_count "gc.get_count") and [`get_stats()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/gc.html#gc.get_stats "gc.get_stats").

    *   For backwards compatibility, [`get_threshold()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/gc.html#gc.get_threshold "gc.get_threshold") continues to return a three-item tuple. The first value is the threshold for young collections, as before; the second value determines the rate at which the old collection is scanned (the default is 10, and higher values mean that the old collection is scanned more slowly). The third value is now meaningless and is always zero.

    *   [`set_threshold()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/gc.html#gc.set_threshold "gc.set_threshold") now ignores any items after the second.

    *   [`get_count()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/gc.html#gc.get_count "gc.get_count") and [`get_stats()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/gc.html#gc.get_stats "gc.get_stats") continue to return the same format of results. The only difference is that instead of the results referring to the young, aging and old generations, the results refer to the young generation and the aging and collecting spaces of the old generation.

In summary, code that attempted to manipulate the behavior of the cycle GC may not work exactly as intended, but it is very unlikely to be harmful. All other code will work just fine.

### io[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#id4 "Link to this heading")

*   Opening and reading files now executes fewer system calls. Reading a small operating system cached file in full is up to 15% faster. (Contributed by Cody Maloney and Victor Stinner in [gh-120754](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120754) and [gh-90102](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90102).)

### pathlib[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#id5 "Link to this heading")

*   [`Path.read_bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.read_bytes "pathlib.Path.read_bytes") now uses unbuffered mode to open files, which is between 9% and 17% faster to read in full. (Contributed by Cody Maloney in [gh-120754](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120754).)

### pdb[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#id6 "Link to this heading")

*   [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") now supports two backends, based on either [`sys.settrace()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.html#sys.settrace "sys.settrace") or [`sys.monitoring`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.monitoring.html#module-sys.monitoring "sys.monitoring: Access and control event monitoring"). Using the [pdb CLI](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#pdb-cli) or [`breakpoint()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#breakpoint "breakpoint") will always use the [`sys.monitoring`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.monitoring.html#module-sys.monitoring "sys.monitoring: Access and control event monitoring") backend. Explicitly instantiating [`pdb.Pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#pdb.Pdb "pdb.Pdb") and its derived classes will use the [`sys.settrace()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.html#sys.settrace "sys.settrace") backend by default, which is configurable. (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-124533](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124533).)

### textwrap[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#textwrap "Link to this heading")

*   Optimize the [`dedent()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/textwrap.html#textwrap.dedent "textwrap.dedent") function, improving performance by an average of 2.4x, with larger improvements for bigger inputs, and fix a bug with incomplete normalization of blank lines with whitespace characters other than space and tab.

### uuid[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#id7 "Link to this heading")

*   [`uuid3()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/uuid.html#uuid.uuid3 "uuid.uuid3") and [`uuid5()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/uuid.html#uuid.uuid5 "uuid.uuid5") are now both roughly 40% faster for 16-byte names and 20% faster for 1024-byte names. Performance for longer names remains unchanged. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in [gh-128150](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128150).)

*   [`uuid4()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/uuid.html#uuid.uuid4 "uuid.uuid4") is now c. 30% faster. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in [gh-128150](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128150).)

### zlib[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#zlib "Link to this heading")

*   On Windows, [zlib-ng](https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng) is now used as the implementation of the [`zlib`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/zlib.html#module-zlib "zlib: Low-level interface to compression and decompression routines compatible with gzip.") module in the default binaries. There are no known incompatibilities between `zlib-ng` and the previously-used `zlib` implementation. This should result in better performance at all compression levels.

It is worth noting that `zlib.Z_BEST_SPEED` (`1`) may result in significantly less compression than the previous implementation, whilst also significantly reducing the time taken to compress.

Removed[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#removed "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### argparse[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#id8 "Link to this heading")

*   Remove the _type_, _choices_, and _metavar_ parameters of `BooleanOptionalAction`. These have been deprecated since Python 3.12. (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in [gh-118805](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118805).)

*   Calling [`add_argument_group()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group "argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group") on an argument group now raises a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError"). Similarly, [`add_argument_group()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group "argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group") or [`add_mutually_exclusive_group()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser.add_mutually_exclusive_group "argparse.ArgumentParser.add_mutually_exclusive_group") on a mutually exclusive group now both raise [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError")s. This ‘nesting’ was never supported, often failed to work correctly, and was unintentionally exposed through inheritance. This functionality has been deprecated since Python 3.11. (Contributed by Savannah Ostrowski in [gh-127186](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127186).)

### ast[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#id9 "Link to this heading")

*   Remove the following classes, which have been deprecated aliases of [`Constant`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ast.html#ast.Constant "ast.Constant") since Python 3.8 and have emitted deprecation warnings since Python 3.12:

    *   `Bytes`

    *   `Ellipsis`

    *   `NameConstant`

    *   `Num`

    *   `Str`

As a consequence of these removals, user-defined `visit_Num`, `visit_Str`, `visit_Bytes`, `visit_NameConstant` and `visit_Ellipsis` methods on custom [`NodeVisitor`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ast.html#ast.NodeVisitor "ast.NodeVisitor") subclasses will no longer be called when the `NodeVisitor` subclass is visiting an AST. Define a `visit_Constant` method instead.

(Contributed by Alex Waygood in [gh-119562](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119562).)

*   Remove the following deprecated properties on [`ast.Constant`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ast.html#ast.Constant "ast.Constant"), which were present for compatibility with the now-removed AST classes:

    *   `Constant.n`

    *   `Constant.s`

Use `Constant.value` instead. (Contributed by Alex Waygood in [gh-119562](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119562).)

### asyncio[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#id10 "Link to this heading")

*   Remove the following classes, methods, and functions, which have been deprecated since Python 3.12:

    *   `AbstractChildWatcher`

    *   `FastChildWatcher`

    *   `MultiLoopChildWatcher`

    *   `PidfdChildWatcher`

    *   `SafeChildWatcher`

    *   `ThreadedChildWatcher`

    *   `AbstractEventLoopPolicy.get_child_watcher()`

    *   `AbstractEventLoopPolicy.set_child_watcher()`

    *   `get_child_watcher()`

    *   `set_child_watcher()`

(Contributed by Kumar Aditya in [gh-120804](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120804).)

*   [`asyncio.get_event_loop()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.get_event_loop "asyncio.get_event_loop") now raises a [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError") if there is no current event loop, and no longer implicitly creates an event loop.

(Contributed by Kumar Aditya in [gh-126353](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/126353).)

There’s a few patterns that use [`asyncio.get_event_loop()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.get_event_loop "asyncio.get_event_loop"), most of them can be replaced with [`asyncio.run()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run "asyncio.run").

If you’re running an async function, simply use [`asyncio.run()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run "asyncio.run").

Before:

async def main():
    ...

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
try:
    loop.run_until_complete(main())
finally:
    loop.close() 
After:

async def main():
    ...

asyncio.run(main()) 
If you need to start something, for example, a server listening on a socket and then run forever, use [`asyncio.run()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run "asyncio.run") and an [`asyncio.Event`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-sync.html#asyncio.Event "asyncio.Event").

Before:

def start_server(loop): ...

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
try:
    start_server(loop)
    loop.run_forever()
finally:
    loop.close() 
After:

def start_server(loop): ...

async def main():
    start_server(asyncio.get_running_loop())
    await asyncio.Event().wait()

asyncio.run(main()) 
If you need to run something in an event loop, then run some blocking code around it, use [`asyncio.Runner`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.Runner "asyncio.Runner").

Before:

async def operation_one(): ...
def blocking_code(): ...
async def operation_two(): ...

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
try:
    loop.run_until_complete(operation_one())
    blocking_code()
    loop.run_until_complete(operation_two())
finally:
    loop.close() 
After:

async def operation_one(): ...
def blocking_code(): ...
async def operation_two(): ...

with asyncio.Runner() as runner:
    runner.run(operation_one())
    blocking_code()
    runner.run(operation_two()) 

### email[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#email "Link to this heading")

*   Remove [`email.utils.localtime()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/email.utils.html#email.utils.localtime "email.utils.localtime")’s _isdst_ parameter, which was deprecated in and has been ignored since Python 3.12. (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-118798](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118798).)

### importlib.abc[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#importlib-abc "Link to this heading")

*   Remove deprecated [`importlib.abc`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/importlib.html#module-importlib.abc "importlib.abc: Abstract base classes related to import") classes:

    *   `ResourceReader` (use [`TraversableResources`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/importlib.resources.abc.html#importlib.resources.abc.TraversableResources "importlib.resources.abc.TraversableResources"))

    *   `Traversable` (use [`Traversable`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/importlib.resources.abc.html#importlib.resources.abc.Traversable "importlib.resources.abc.Traversable"))

    *   `TraversableResources` (use [`TraversableResources`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/importlib.resources.abc.html#importlib.resources.abc.TraversableResources "importlib.resources.abc.TraversableResources"))

(Contributed by Jason R. Coombs and Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-93963](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93963).)

### itertools[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#itertools "Link to this heading")

*   Remove support for copy, deepcopy, and pickle operations from [`itertools`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/itertools.html#module-itertools "itertools: Functions creating iterators for efficient looping.") iterators. These have emitted a [`DeprecationWarning`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") since Python 3.12. (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger in [gh-101588](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101588).)

### pathlib[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#id11 "Link to this heading")

*   Remove support for passing additional keyword arguments to [`Path`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path "pathlib.Path"). In previous versions, any such arguments are ignored. (Contributed by Barney Gale in [gh-74033](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/74033).)

*   Remove support for passing additional positional arguments to [`PurePath.relative_to()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.relative_to "pathlib.PurePath.relative_to") and [`is_relative_to()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.is_relative_to "pathlib.PurePath.is_relative_to"). In previous versions, any such arguments are joined onto _other_. (Contributed by Barney Gale in [gh-78707](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/78707).)

### pkgutil[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pkgutil "Link to this heading")

*   Remove the `get_loader()` and `find_loader()` functions, which have been deprecated since Python 3.12. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in [gh-97850](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97850).)

### pty[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pty "Link to this heading")

*   Remove the `master_open()` and `slave_open()` functions, which have been deprecated since Python 3.12. Use [`pty.openpty()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pty.html#pty.openpty "pty.openpty") instead. (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in [gh-118824](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118824).)

### sqlite3[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#sqlite3 "Link to this heading")

*   Remove `version` and `version_info` from the [`sqlite3`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") module; use [`sqlite_version`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.sqlite_version "sqlite3.sqlite_version") and [`sqlite_version_info`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.sqlite_version_info "sqlite3.sqlite_version_info") for the actual version number of the runtime SQLite library. (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-118924](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/118924).)

*   Using a sequence of parameters with named placeholders now raises a [`ProgrammingError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.ProgrammingError "sqlite3.ProgrammingError"), having been deprecated since Python 3.12.

The low overhead dynamic frame locals access added in Python 3.13 by [**PEP 667**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0667/) means the frame locals cache reference previously stored in this attribute is no longer needed. Derived debuggers should access `pdb.Pdb.curframe.f_locals` directly in Python 3.13 and later versions. (Contributed by Tian Gao in [gh-124369](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124369) and [gh-125951](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125951).)

No direct replacement exists. _Anything_ is better than CGI to interface a web server with a request handler.

    *   The `--cgi` flag to the **python -m http.server** command-line interface has been deprecated since Python 3.13.

*   [`importlib`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/importlib.html#module-importlib "importlib: The implementation of the import machinery."):

    *   `load_module()` method: use `exec_module()` instead.

*   [`locale`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/locale.html#module-locale "locale: Internationalization services."):

    *   The [`getdefaultlocale()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/locale.html#locale.getdefaultlocale "locale.getdefaultlocale") function has been deprecated since Python 3.11. Its removal was originally planned for Python 3.13 ([gh-90817](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90817)), but has been postponed to Python 3.15. Use [`getlocale()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/locale.html#locale.getlocale "locale.getlocale"), [`setlocale()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/locale.html#locale.setlocale "locale.setlocale"), and [`getencoding()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/locale.html#locale.getencoding "locale.getencoding") instead.

    *   [`java_ver()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/platform.html#platform.java_ver "platform.java_ver") has been deprecated since Python 3.13. This function is only useful for Jython support, has a confusing API, and is largely untested.

*   [`sysconfig`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig "sysconfig: Python's configuration information"):

    *   The _check\_home_ argument of [`sysconfig.is_python_build()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sysconfig.html#sysconfig.is_python_build "sysconfig.is_python_build") has been deprecated since Python 3.12.

*   [`threading`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/threading.html#module-threading "threading: Thread-based parallelism."):

    *   [`RLock()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/threading.html#threading.RLock "threading.RLock") will take no arguments in Python 3.15. Passing any arguments has been deprecated since Python 3.14, as the Python version does not permit any arguments, but the C version allows any number of positional or keyword arguments, ignoring every argument.

*   [`types`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/types.html#module-types "types: Names for built-in types."):

May be removed in 3.15. (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in [gh-101866](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101866).)

*   [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints (see :pep:`484`)."):

    *   The undocumented keyword argument syntax for creating [`NamedTuple`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple "typing.NamedTuple") classes (for example, `Point = NamedTuple("Point", x=int, y=int)`) has been deprecated since Python 3.13. Use the class-based syntax or the functional syntax instead.

    *   When using the functional syntax of [`TypedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict "typing.TypedDict")s, failing to pass a value to the _fields_ parameter (`TD = TypedDict("TD")`) or passing `None` (`TD = TypedDict("TD", None)`) has been deprecated since Python 3.13. Use `class TD(TypedDict): pass` or `TD = TypedDict("TD", {})` to create a TypedDict with zero field.

    *   The [`typing.no_type_check_decorator()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.no_type_check_decorator "typing.no_type_check_decorator") decorator function has been deprecated since Python 3.13. After eight years in the [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints (see :pep:`484`).") module, it has yet to be supported by any major type checker.

*   [`wave`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/wave.html#module-wave "wave: Provide an interface to the WAV sound format."):

    *   The [`getmark()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getmark "wave.Wave_read.getmark"), `setmark()`, and [`getmarkers()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read.getmarkers "wave.Wave_read.getmarkers") methods of the [`Wave_read`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_read "wave.Wave_read") and [`Wave_write`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/wave.html#wave.Wave_write "wave.Wave_write") classes have been deprecated since Python 3.13.

*   [`zipimport`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/zipimport.html#module-zipimport "zipimport: Support for importing Python modules from ZIP archives."):

    *   [`load_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/zipimport.html#zipimport.zipimporter.load_module "zipimport.zipimporter.load_module") has been deprecated since Python 3.10. Use [`exec_module()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/zipimport.html#zipimport.zipimporter.exec_module "zipimport.zipimporter.exec_module") instead.

*   [`builtins`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace."):

    *   Bitwise inversion on boolean types, `~True` or `~False` has been deprecated since Python 3.12, as it produces surprising and unintuitive results (`-2` and `-1`). Use `not x` instead for the logical negation of a Boolean. In the rare case that you need the bitwise inversion of the underlying integer, convert to `int` explicitly (`~int(x)`).

*   [`functools`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functools.html#module-functools "functools: Higher-order functions and operations on callable objects."):

    *   Calling the Python implementation of [`functools.reduce()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functools.html#functools.reduce "functools.reduce") with _function_ or _sequence_ as keyword arguments has been deprecated since Python 3.14.

*   [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/logging.html#module-logging "logging: Flexible event logging system for applications."):

Support for custom logging handlers with the _strm_ argument is deprecated and scheduled for removal in Python 3.16. Define handlers with the _stream_ argument instead. (Contributed by Mariusz Felisiak in [gh-115032](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115032).)

*   [`mimetypes`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/mimetypes.html#module-mimetypes "mimetypes: Mapping of filename extensions to MIME types."):

    *   Valid extensions start with a ‘.’ or are empty for [`mimetypes.MimeTypes.add_type()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/mimetypes.html#mimetypes.MimeTypes.add_type "mimetypes.MimeTypes.add_type"). Undotted extensions are deprecated and will raise a [`ValueError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") in Python 3.16. (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [gh-75223](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/75223).)

*   [`shutil`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/shutil.html#module-shutil "shutil: High-level file operations, including copying."):

    *   The `ExecError` exception has been deprecated since Python 3.14. It has not been used by any function in `shutil` since Python 3.4, and is now an alias of [`RuntimeError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError "RuntimeError").

*   [`symtable`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/symtable.html#module-symtable "symtable: Interface to the compiler's internal symbol tables."):

    *   The [`Class.get_methods`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/symtable.html#symtable.Class.get_methods "symtable.Class.get_methods") method has been deprecated since Python 3.14.

    *   The [`_enablelegacywindowsfsencoding()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.html#sys._enablelegacywindowsfsencoding "sys._enablelegacywindowsfsencoding") function has been deprecated since Python 3.13. Use the [`PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING) environment variable instead.

*   [`sysconfig`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig "sysconfig: Python's configuration information"):

    *   The `sysconfig.expand_makefile_vars()` function has been deprecated since Python 3.14. Use the `vars` argument of [`sysconfig.get_paths()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sysconfig.html#sysconfig.get_paths "sysconfig.get_paths") instead.

### Pending removal in Python 3.17[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pending-removal-in-python-3-17 "Link to this heading")

*   [`collections.abc`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc "collections.abc: Abstract base classes for containers"):

    *   [`collections.abc.ByteString`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.ByteString "collections.abc.ByteString") is scheduled for removal in Python 3.17.

Use `isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Buffer)` to test if `obj` implements the [buffer protocol](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/buffer.html#bufferobjects) at runtime. For use in type annotations, either use [`Buffer`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Buffer "collections.abc.Buffer") or a union that explicitly specifies the types your code supports (e.g., `bytes | bytearray | memoryview`).

`ByteString` was originally intended to be an abstract class that would serve as a supertype of both [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") and [`bytearray`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray"). However, since the ABC never had any methods, knowing that an object was an instance of `ByteString` never actually told you anything useful about the object. Other common buffer types such as [`memoryview`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview "memoryview") were also never understood as subtypes of `ByteString` (either at runtime or by static type checkers).

See [**PEP 688**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0688/#current-options) for more details. (Contributed by Shantanu Jain in [gh-91896](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91896).)

*   [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#module-typing "typing: Support for type hints (see :pep:`484`)."):

    *   Before Python 3.14, old-style unions were implemented using the private class `typing._UnionGenericAlias`. This class is no longer needed for the implementation, but it has been retained for backward compatibility, with removal scheduled for Python 3.17. Users should use documented introspection helpers like [`typing.get_origin()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.get_origin "typing.get_origin") and [`typing.get_args()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.get_args "typing.get_args") instead of relying on private implementation details.

    *   [`typing.ByteString`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.ByteString "typing.ByteString"), deprecated since Python 3.9, is scheduled for removal in Python 3.17.

Use `isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Buffer)` to test if `obj` implements the [buffer protocol](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/buffer.html#bufferobjects) at runtime. For use in type annotations, either use [`Buffer`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Buffer "collections.abc.Buffer") or a union that explicitly specifies the types your code supports (e.g., `bytes | bytearray | memoryview`).

### Pending removal in Python 3.18[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pending-removal-in-python-3-18 "Link to this heading")

*   [`decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/decimal.html#module-decimal "decimal: Implementation of the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification."):

    *   The non-standard and undocumented [`Decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal "decimal.Decimal") format specifier `'N'`, which is only supported in the `decimal` module’s C implementation, has been deprecated since Python 3.13. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-89902](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/89902).)

### Pending removal in Python 3.19[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pending-removal-in-python-3-19 "Link to this heading")

*   [`ctypes`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes "ctypes: A foreign function library for Python."):

    *   Implicitly switching to the MSVC-compatible struct layout by setting [`_pack_`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure._pack_ "ctypes.Structure._pack_") but not [`_layout_`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure._layout_ "ctypes.Structure._layout_") on non-Windows platforms.

### Pending removal in future versions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pending-removal-in-future-versions "Link to this heading")

The following APIs will be removed in the future, although there is currently no date scheduled for their removal.

*   [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/argparse.html#module-argparse "argparse: Command-line option and argument parsing library."):

    *   Nesting argument groups and nesting mutually exclusive groups are deprecated.

    *   Passing the undocumented keyword argument _prefix\_chars_ to [`add_argument_group()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/argparse.html#argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group "argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group") is now deprecated.

    *   The [`argparse.FileType`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/argparse.html#argparse.FileType "argparse.FileType") type converter is deprecated.

*   [`builtins`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/builtins.html#module-builtins "builtins: The module that provides the built-in namespace."):

    *   Generators: `throw(type, exc, tb)` and `athrow(type, exc, tb)` signature is deprecated: use `throw(exc)` and `athrow(exc)` instead, the single argument signature.

    *   Currently Python accepts numeric literals immediately followed by keywords, for example `0in x`, `1or x`, `0if 1else 2`. It allows confusing and ambiguous expressions like `[0x1for x in y]` (which can be interpreted as `[0x1 for x in y]` or `[0x1f or x in y]`). A syntax warning is raised if the numeric literal is immediately followed by one of keywords [`and`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/expressions.html#and), [`else`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/compound_stmts.html#else), [`for`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/compound_stmts.html#for), [`if`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/compound_stmts.html#if), [`in`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/expressions.html#in), [`is`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/expressions.html#is) and [`or`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/expressions.html#or). In a future release it will be changed to a syntax error. ([gh-87999](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87999))

    *   Support for `__index__()` and `__int__()` method returning non-int type: these methods will be required to return an instance of a strict subclass of [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#int "int").

    *   Support for `__float__()` method returning a strict subclass of [`float`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#float "float"): these methods will be required to return an instance of [`float`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#float "float").

    *   Support for `__complex__()` method returning a strict subclass of [`complex`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#complex "complex"): these methods will be required to return an instance of [`complex`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#complex "complex").

    *   Passing a complex number as the _real_ or _imag_ argument in the [`complex()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#complex "complex") constructor is now deprecated; it should only be passed as a single positional argument. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-109218](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/109218).)

*   [`calendar`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/calendar.html#module-calendar "calendar: Functions for working with calendars, including some emulation of the Unix cal program."): `calendar.January` and `calendar.February` constants are deprecated and replaced by [`calendar.JANUARY`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/calendar.html#calendar.JANUARY "calendar.JANUARY") and [`calendar.FEBRUARY`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/calendar.html#calendar.FEBRUARY "calendar.FEBRUARY"). (Contributed by Prince Roshan in [gh-103636](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103636).)

*   [`codecs`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/codecs.html#module-codecs "codecs: Encode and decode data and streams."): use [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#open "open") instead of [`codecs.open()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/codecs.html#codecs.open "codecs.open"). ([gh-133038](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133038))

*   [`codeobject.co_lnotab`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_lnotab "codeobject.co_lnotab"): use the [`codeobject.co_lines()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/datamodel.html#codeobject.co_lines "codeobject.co_lines") method instead.

CPython bytecode changes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#cpython-bytecode-changes "Link to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Replaced the opcode `BINARY_SUBSCR` by the [`BINARY_OP`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/dis.html#opcode-BINARY_OP) opcode with the `NB_SUBSCR` oparg. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in [gh-100239](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100239).)

*   Add the [`BUILD_INTERPOLATION`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/dis.html#opcode-BUILD_INTERPOLATION) and [`BUILD_TEMPLATE`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/dis.html#opcode-BUILD_TEMPLATE) opcodes to construct new [`Interpolation`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/string.templatelib.html#string.templatelib.Interpolation "string.templatelib.Interpolation") and [`Template`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/string.templatelib.html#string.templatelib.Template "string.templatelib.Template") instances, respectively. (Contributed by Lysandros Nikolaou and others in [gh-132661](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132661); see also [PEP 750: Template strings](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-template-string-literals)).

*   Remove the `BUILD_CONST_KEY_MAP` opcode. Use [`BUILD_MAP`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/dis.html#opcode-BUILD_MAP) instead. (Contributed by Mark Shannon in [gh-122160](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122160).)

*   Replace the `LOAD_ASSERTION_ERROR` opcode with [`LOAD_COMMON_CONSTANT`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/dis.html#opcode-LOAD_COMMON_CONSTANT) and add support for loading [`NotImplementedError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#NotImplementedError "NotImplementedError").

*   Add the [`LOAD_FAST_BORROW`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/dis.html#opcode-LOAD_FAST_BORROW) and [`LOAD_FAST_BORROW_LOAD_FAST_BORROW`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/dis.html#opcode-LOAD_FAST_BORROW_LOAD_FAST_BORROW) opcodes to reduce reference counting overhead when the interpreter can prove that the reference in the frame outlives the reference loaded onto the stack. (Contributed by Matt Page in [gh-130704](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130704).)

*   Add the [`LOAD_SMALL_INT`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/dis.html#opcode-LOAD_SMALL_INT) opcode, which pushes a small integer equal to the `oparg` to the stack. The `RETURN_CONST` opcode is removed as it is no longer used. (Contributed by Mark Shannon in [gh-125837](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125837).)

*   Add the new [`LOAD_SPECIAL`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/dis.html#opcode-LOAD_SPECIAL) instruction.

### Pseudo-instructions[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pseudo-instructions "Link to this heading")

*   Add the `ANNOTATIONS_PLACEHOLDER` pseudo instruction to support partially executed module-level annotations with [deferred evaluation of annotations](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-deferred-annotations). (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in [gh-130907](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130907).)

*   Add the `BINARY_OP_EXTEND` pseudo instruction, which executes a pair of functions (guard and specialization functions) accessed from the inline cache. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in [gh-100239](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100239).)

*   Add three specializations for [`CALL_KW`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/dis.html#opcode-CALL_KW); `CALL_KW_PY` for calls to Python functions, `CALL_KW_BOUND_METHOD` for calls to bound methods, and `CALL_KW_NON_PY` for all other calls.

C API changes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#c-api-changes "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Python configuration C API[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#python-configuration-c-api "Link to this heading")

Add a [PyInitConfig C API](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/init_config.html#pyinitconfig-api) to configure the Python initialization without relying on C structures and the ability to make ABI-compatible changes in the future.

Complete the [**PEP 587**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0587/)[PyConfig C API](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/init_config.html#pyconfig-api) by adding [`PyInitConfig_AddModule()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/init_config.html#c.PyInitConfig_AddModule "PyInitConfig_AddModule") which can be used to add a built-in extension module; a feature previously referred to as the “inittab”.

Add [`PyConfig_Get()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/init_config.html#c.PyConfig_Get "PyConfig_Get") and [`PyConfig_Set()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/init_config.html#c.PyConfig_Set "PyConfig_Set") functions to get and set the current runtime configuration.

[**PEP 587**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0587/) ‘Python Initialization Configuration’ unified all the ways to configure Python’s initialization. This PEP also unifies the configuration of Python’s preinitialization and initialization in a single API. Moreover, this PEP only provides a single choice to embed Python, instead of having two ‘Python’ and ‘Isolated’ choices (PEP 587), to further simplify the API.

The lower level PEP 587 PyConfig API remains available for use cases with an intentionally higher level of coupling to CPython implementation details (such as emulating the full functionality of CPython’s CLI, including its configuration mechanisms).

This is useful for comparisons with [`Py_Version`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/apiabiversion.html#c.Py_Version "Py_Version") or [`PY_VERSION_HEX`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/apiabiversion.html#c.PY_VERSION_HEX "PY_VERSION_HEX"). (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in [gh-128629](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/128629).)

*   Add [`PyBytes_Join(sep, iterable)`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/bytes.html#c.PyBytes_Join "PyBytes_Join") function, similar to `sep.join(iterable)` in Python. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [gh-121645](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121645).)

*   Add [`Py_fopen()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/sys.html#c.Py_fopen "Py_fopen") function to open a file. This works similarly to the standard C `fopen()` function, instead accepting a Python object for the _path_ parameter and setting an exception on error. The corresponding new [`Py_fclose()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/sys.html#c.Py_fclose "Py_fclose") function should be used to close a file.

*   Add [`PyIter_NextItem()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/iter.html#c.PyIter_NextItem "PyIter_NextItem") to replace [`PyIter_Next()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/iter.html#c.PyIter_Next "PyIter_Next"), which has an ambiguous return value. (Contributed by Irit Katriel and Erlend Aasland in [gh-105201](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105201).)

*   Add [`PyLong_GetSign()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_GetSign "PyLong_GetSign") function to get the sign of [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#int "int") objects. (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in [gh-116560](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/116560).)

*   Add new functions to convert C `<stdint.h>` numbers to/from Python [`int`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#int "int") objects:

    *   [`PyLong_AsInt32()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_AsInt32 "PyLong_AsInt32")

    *   [`PyLong_AsInt64()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_AsInt64 "PyLong_AsInt64")

*   Add [`PyUnstable_Object_IsUniquelyReferenced()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/object.html#c.PyUnstable_Object_IsUniquelyReferenced "PyUnstable_Object_IsUniquelyReferenced") as a replacement for `Py_REFCNT(op) == 1` on [free threaded](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-free-threading) builds. (Contributed by Peter Bierma in [gh-133140](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133140).)

*   Add [`PyUnstable_Object_IsUniqueReferencedTemporary()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/object.html#c.PyUnstable_Object_IsUniqueReferencedTemporary "PyUnstable_Object_IsUniqueReferencedTemporary") to determine if an object is a unique temporary object on the interpreter’s operand stack. This can be used in some cases as a replacement for checking if [`Py_REFCNT()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_REFCNT "Py_REFCNT") is `1` for Python objects passed as arguments to C API functions.

### Limited C API changes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#limited-c-api-changes "Link to this heading")

*   In the limited C API version 3.14 and newer, [`Py_TYPE()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/structures.html#c.Py_TYPE "Py_TYPE") and [`Py_REFCNT()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_REFCNT "Py_REFCNT") are now implemented as an opaque function call to hide implementation details. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [gh-120600](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120600) and [gh-124127](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124127).)

*   Remove the [`PySequence_Fast_GET_SIZE`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/sequence.html#c.PySequence_Fast_GET_SIZE "PySequence_Fast_GET_SIZE"), [`PySequence_Fast_GET_ITEM`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/sequence.html#c.PySequence_Fast_GET_ITEM "PySequence_Fast_GET_ITEM"), and [`PySequence_Fast_ITEMS`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/sequence.html#c.PySequence_Fast_ITEMS "PySequence_Fast_ITEMS") macros from the limited C API, since they have always been broken in the limited C API. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [gh-91417](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91417).)

### Removed C APIs[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#removed-c-apis "Link to this heading")

*   Creating [`immutable types`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/typeobj.html#c.Py_TPFLAGS_IMMUTABLETYPE "Py_TPFLAGS_IMMUTABLETYPE") with mutable bases was deprecated in Python 3.12, and now raises a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError"). (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in [gh-119775](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119775).)

*   Remove `PyDictObject.ma_version_tag` member, which was deprecated in Python 3.12. Use the [`PyDict_AddWatcher()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/dict.html#c.PyDict_AddWatcher "PyDict_AddWatcher") API instead. (Contributed by Sam Gross in [gh-124296](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124296).)

*   Remove the private `_Py_InitializeMain()` function. It was a [provisional API](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-provisional-API) added to Python 3.8 by [**PEP 587**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0587/). (Contributed by Victor Stinner in [gh-129033](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129033).)

*   Remove the undocumented APIs `Py_C_RECURSION_LIMIT` and `PyThreadState.c_recursion_remaining`. These were added in 3.13 and have been removed without deprecation.

Build changes[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#build-changes "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   [**PEP 776**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0776/): Emscripten is now an officially supported platform at [**tier 3**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3). As a part of this effort, more than 25 bugs in [Emscripten libc](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/emscripten-runtime-environment.html) were fixed. Emscripten now includes support for [`ctypes`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes "ctypes: A foreign function library for Python."), [`termios`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/termios.html#module-termios "termios: POSIX style tty control."), and [`fcntl`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/fcntl.html#module-fcntl "fcntl: The fcntl() and ioctl() system calls."), as well as experimental support for the new [default interactive shell](https://docs.python.org/3.14/tutorial/interpreter.html#tut-interactive). (Contributed by R. Hood Chatham in [gh-127146](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127146), [gh-127683](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127683), and [gh-136931](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/136931).)

*   Official Android binary releases are now provided on [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/android/).

*   GNU Autoconf 2.72 is now required to generate `configure`. (Contributed by Erlend Aasland in [gh-115765](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/115765).)

*   `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` is now a [**PEP 11**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/) tier 3 platform. (Contributed by R. Hood Chatham in [gh-127146](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127146), [gh-127683](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127683), and [gh-136931](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/136931).)

*   `#pragma`-based linking with `python3*.lib` can now be switched off with [Py_NO_LINK_LIB](https://docs.python.org/3.14/extending/windows.html#c.Py_NO_LINK_LIB "Py_NO_LINK_LIB"). (Contributed by Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin in [gh-82909](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82909).)

*   CPython now enables a set of recommended compiler options by default for improved security. Use the [`--disable-safety`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/configure.html#cmdoption-disable-safety)`configure` option to disable them, or the [`--enable-slower-safety`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/configure.html#cmdoption-enable-slower-safety) option for a larger set of compiler options, albeit with a performance cost.

*   The `WITH_FREELISTS` macro and `--without-freelists``configure` option have been removed.

*   The new `configure` option [`--with-tail-call-interp`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-tail-call-interp) may be used to enable the experimental tail call interpreter. See [A new type of interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-tail-call-interpreter) for further details.

*   To disable the new remote debugging support, use the [`--without-remote-debug`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/configure.html#cmdoption-without-remote-debug)`configure` option. This may be useful for security reasons.

*   iOS and macOS apps can now be configured to redirect `stdout` and `stderr` content to the system log. (Contributed by Russell Keith-Magee in [gh-127592](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127592).)

*   The iOS testbed is now able to stream test output while the test is running. The testbed can also be used to run the test suite of projects other than CPython itself. (Contributed by Russell Keith-Magee in [gh-127592](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127592).)

### `build-details.json`[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#build-details-json "Link to this heading")

Installations of Python now contain a new file, `build-details.json`. This is a static JSON document containing build details for CPython, to allow for introspection without needing to run code. This is helpful for use-cases such as Python launchers, cross-compilation, and so on.

`build-details.json` must be installed in the platform-independent standard library directory. This corresponds to the [‘stdlib’](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sysconfig.html#installation-paths)[`sysconfig`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig "sysconfig: Python's configuration information") installation path, which can be found by running `sysconfig.get_path('stdlib')`.

See also

[**PEP 739**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0739/) – `build-details.json` 1.0 – a static description file for Python build details

### Discontinuation of PGP signatures[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#discontinuation-of-pgp-signatures "Link to this heading")

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) signatures will not be provided for releases of Python 3.14 or future versions. To verify CPython artifacts, users must use [Sigstore verification materials](https://www.python.org/downloads/metadata/sigstore/). Releases have been signed using [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) since Python 3.11.

This change in release process was specified in [**PEP 761**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0761/).

### Free-threaded Python is officially supported[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#free-threaded-python-is-officially-supported "Link to this heading")

The free-threaded build of Python is now supported and no longer experimental. This is the start of [phase II](https://discuss.python.org/t/37075) where free-threaded Python is officially supported but still optional.

The free-threading team are confident that the project is on the right path, and appreciate the continued dedication from everyone working to make free-threading ready for broader adoption across the Python community.

With these recommendations and the acceptance of this PEP, the Python developer community should broadly advertise that free-threading is a supported Python build option now and into the future, and that it will not be removed without a proper deprecation schedule.

Any decision to transition to [phase III](https://discuss.python.org/t/37075), with free-threading as the default or sole build of Python is still undecided, and dependent on many factors both within CPython itself and the community. This decision is for the future.

### Binary releases for the experimental just-in-time compiler[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#binary-releases-for-the-experimental-just-in-time-compiler "Link to this heading")

The official macOS and Windows release binaries now include an _experimental_ just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Although it is **not** recommended for production use, it can be tested by setting [`PYTHON_JIT=1`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHON_JIT) as an environment variable. Downstream source builds and redistributors can use the [`--enable-experimental-jit=yes-off`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/configure.html#cmdoption-enable-experimental-jit) configuration option for similar behavior.

The JIT is at an early stage and still in active development. As such, the typical performance impact of enabling it can range from 10% slower to 20% faster, depending on workload. To aid in testing and evaluation, a set of introspection functions has been provided in the [`sys._jit`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.html#sys._jit "sys._jit") namespace. [`sys._jit.is_available()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.html#sys._jit.is_available "sys._jit.is_available") can be used to determine if the current executable supports JIT compilation, while [`sys._jit.is_enabled()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.html#sys._jit.is_enabled "sys._jit.is_enabled") can be used to tell if JIT compilation has been enabled for the current process.

Currently, the most significant missing functionality is that native debuggers and profilers like `gdb` and `perf` are unable to unwind through JIT frames (Python debuggers and profilers, like [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/pdb.html#module-pdb "pdb: The Python debugger for interactive interpreters.") or [`profile`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/profile.html#module-profile "profile: Python source profiler."), continue to work without modification). Free-threaded builds do not support JIT compilation.

Please report any bugs or major performance regressions that you encounter!

Porting to Python 3.14[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#porting-to-python-3-14 "Link to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes that may require changes to your code.

### Changes in the Python API[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#changes-in-the-python-api "Link to this heading")

*   On Unix platforms other than macOS, _forkserver_ is now the default [start method](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-methods) for [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism.") and [`ProcessPoolExecutor`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor"), instead of _fork_.

See [(1)](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-concurrent-futures-start-method) and [(2)](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-multiprocessing-start-method) for details.

If you encounter [`NameError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#NameError "NameError")s or pickling errors coming out of [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism.") or [`concurrent.futures`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures "concurrent.futures: Execute computations concurrently using threads or processes."), see the [forkserver restrictions](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-programming-forkserver).

This change does not affect Windows or macOS, where [‘spawn’](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-start-method-spawn) remains the default start method.

*   [`functools.partial`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functools.html#functools.partial "functools.partial") is now a method descriptor. Wrap it in [`staticmethod()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/functions.html#staticmethod "staticmethod") if you want to preserve the old behavior. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka and Dominykas Grigonis in [gh-121027](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/121027).)

*   The [garbage collector is now incremental](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-incremental-gc), which means that the behavior of [`gc.collect()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/gc.html#gc.collect "gc.collect") changes slightly:

    *   `gc.collect(1)`: Performs an increment of garbage collection, rather than collecting generation 1.

    *   Other calls to `gc.collect()` are unchanged.

*   The [`locale.nl_langinfo()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/locale.html#locale.nl_langinfo "locale.nl_langinfo") function now temporarily sets the `LC_CTYPE` locale in some cases. This temporary change affects other threads. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in [gh-69998](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/69998).)

*   [`types.UnionType`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/types.html#types.UnionType "types.UnionType") is now an alias for [`typing.Union`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/typing.html#typing.Union "typing.Union"), causing changes in some behaviors. See [above](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-typing-union) for more details. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in [gh-105499](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105499).)

*   The runtime behavior of annotations has changed in various ways; see [above](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-deferred-annotations) for details. While most code that interacts with annotations should continue to work, some undocumented details may behave differently.

*   As part of making the [`mimetypes`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/mimetypes.html#module-mimetypes "mimetypes: Mapping of filename extensions to MIME types.") CLI public, it now exits with `1` on failure instead of `0` and `2` on incorrect command-line parameters instead of `1`. Error messages are now printed to stderr.

*   The `\B` pattern in regular expression now matches the empty string when given as the entire pattern, which may cause behavioural changes.

*   On FreeBSD, [`sys.platform`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/sys.html#sys.platform "sys.platform") no longer contains the major version number.

### Changes in annotations ([**PEP 649**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/) and [**PEP 749**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0749/))[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#changes-in-annotations-pep-649-and-pep-749 "Link to this heading")

This section contains guidance on changes that may be needed to annotations or Python code that interacts with or introspects annotations, due to the changes related to [deferred evaluation of annotations](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-deferred-annotations).

In the majority of cases, working code from older versions of Python will not require any changes.

#### Implications for annotated code[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#implications-for-annotated-code "Link to this heading")

If you define annotations in your code (for example, for use with a static type checker), then this change probably does not affect you: you can keep writing annotations the same way you did with previous versions of Python.

You will likely be able to remove quoted strings in annotations, which are frequently used for forward references. Similarly, if you use `from __future__ import annotations` to avoid having to write strings in annotations, you may well be able to remove that import once you support only Python 3.14 and newer. However, if you rely on third-party libraries that read annotations, those libraries may need changes to support unquoted annotations before they work as expected.

#### Implications for readers of `__annotations__`[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#implications-for-readers-of-annotations "Link to this heading")

If your code reads the [`__annotations__`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/datamodel.html#object.__annotations__ "object.__annotations__") attribute on objects, you may want to make changes in order to support code that relies on deferred evaluation of annotations. For example, you may want to use [`annotationlib.get_annotations()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.get_annotations "annotationlib.get_annotations") with the [`FORWARDREF`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF "annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF") format, as the [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/dataclasses.html#module-dataclasses "dataclasses: Generate special methods on user-defined classes.") module now does.

The external [typing_extensions](https://pypi.org/project/typing_extensions/) package provides partial backports of some of the functionality of the [`annotationlib`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/annotationlib.html#module-annotationlib "annotationlib: Functionality for introspecting annotations") module, such as the [`Format`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.Format "annotationlib.Format") enum and the [`get_annotations()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/annotationlib.html#annotationlib.get_annotations "annotationlib.get_annotations") function. These can be used to write cross-version code that takes advantage of the new behavior in Python 3.14.

#### `from __future__ import annotations`[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#from-future-import-annotations "Link to this heading")

In Python 3.7, [**PEP 563**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/) introduced the `from __future__ import annotations`[future statement](https://docs.python.org/3.14/reference/simple_stmts.html#future), which turns all annotations into strings.

However, this statement is now deprecated and it is expected to be removed in a future version of Python. This removal will not happen until after Python 3.13 reaches its end of life in 2029, being the last version of Python without support for deferred evaluation of annotations.

In Python 3.14, the behavior of code using `from __future__ import annotations` is unchanged.

### Changes in the C API[¶](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#changes-in-the-c-api "Link to this heading")

*   [`Py_Finalize()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/interp-lifecycle.html#c.Py_Finalize "Py_Finalize") now deletes all interned strings. This is backwards incompatible to any C extension that holds onto an interned string after a call to [`Py_Finalize()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/interp-lifecycle.html#c.Py_Finalize "Py_Finalize") and is then reused after a call to [`Py_Initialize()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/interp-lifecycle.html#c.Py_Initialize "Py_Initialize"). Any issues arising from this behavior will normally result in crashes during the execution of the subsequent call to [`Py_Initialize()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/interp-lifecycle.html#c.Py_Initialize "Py_Initialize") from accessing uninitialized memory. To fix, use an address sanitizer to identify any use-after-free coming from an interned string and deallocate it during module shutdown. (Contributed by Eddie Elizondo in [gh-113601](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/113601).)

*   The [Unicode Exception Objects](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/exceptions.html#unicodeexceptions) C API now raises a [`TypeError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") if its exception argument is not a [`UnicodeError`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/exceptions.html#UnicodeError "UnicodeError") object. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in [gh-127691](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127691).)

*   The interpreter internally avoids some reference count modifications when loading objects onto the operands stack by [borrowing](https://docs.python.org/3.14/glossary.html#term-borrowed-reference) references when possible. This can lead to smaller reference count values compared to previous Python versions. C API extensions that checked [`Py_REFCNT()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_REFCNT "Py_REFCNT") of `1` to determine if an function argument is not referenced by any other code should instead use [`PyUnstable_Object_IsUniqueReferencedTemporary()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/object.html#c.PyUnstable_Object_IsUniqueReferencedTemporary "PyUnstable_Object_IsUniqueReferencedTemporary") as a safer replacement.

*   Private functions promoted to public C APIs:

    *   `_PyBytes_Join()`: [`PyBytes_Join()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/bytes.html#c.PyBytes_Join "PyBytes_Join")

    *   `_PyUnicodeWriter_Dealloc()`: [`PyUnicodeWriter_Discard()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/unicode.html#c.PyUnicodeWriter_Discard "PyUnicodeWriter_Discard")

    *   `_PyUnicodeWriter_Finish()`: [`PyUnicodeWriter_Finish()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/unicode.html#c.PyUnicodeWriter_Finish "PyUnicodeWriter_Finish")

    *   `_PyUnicodeWriter_Init()`: use [`PyUnicodeWriter_Create()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/unicode.html#c.PyUnicodeWriter_Create "PyUnicodeWriter_Create")

    *   `_PyUnicodeWriter_Prepare()`: (no replacement)

    *   `_PyUnicodeWriter_PrepareKind()`: (no replacement)

    *   `_PyUnicodeWriter_WriteChar()`: [`PyUnicodeWriter_WriteChar()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/unicode.html#c.PyUnicodeWriter_WriteChar "PyUnicodeWriter_WriteChar")

    *   `_PyUnicodeWriter_WriteStr()`: [`PyUnicodeWriter_WriteStr()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/unicode.html#c.PyUnicodeWriter_WriteStr "PyUnicodeWriter_WriteStr")

    *   `_PyUnicode_EQ()`: [`PyUnicode_Equal()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/unicode.html#c.PyUnicode_Equal "PyUnicode_Equal")

    *   `_PyUnicode_Equal()`: [`PyUnicode_Equal()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/unicode.html#c.PyUnicode_Equal "PyUnicode_Equal")

    *   `_Py_GetConfig()`: [`PyConfig_Get()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/init_config.html#c.PyConfig_Get "PyConfig_Get") and [`PyConfig_GetInt()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/init_config.html#c.PyConfig_GetInt "PyConfig_GetInt")

    *   `_Py_HashBytes()`: [`Py_HashBuffer()`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/c-api/hash.html#c.Py_HashBuffer "Py_HashBuffer")
