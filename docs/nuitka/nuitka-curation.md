---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nuitka is the optimizing Python compiler written in Python that creates executables that run without a separate installer. Data files can both be included or put alongside.

Nuitka is fully compatible with **Python 3** (3.4 — 3.13) and **Python 2** (2.6, 2.7), and works on **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux**, and more — essentially, wherever Python is already compatible with your system.
